abstract = {Traditional transdermal drug delivery methods are often plagued by technical inefficiencies, limited absorption, and the potential for adverse reactions. In contrast, dissolving microneedles (DMNs) offer a novel approach to transdermal drug delivery by effectively merging the benefits of subcutaneous injection with those of conventional transdermal methods. These microneedles dissolve completely within the body, releasing the encapsulated antigen without leaving any sharp remnants. Furthermore, DMNs overcome the limitations of traditional transdermal patches, which are restricted to delivering only small molecule drugs. By facilitating the efficient transdermal absorption of large molecules, DMNs enable precise and painless disease treatment. With advantages such as effective delivery, safety, controllable administration, DMNs hold significant promise in the fields of disease treatment and drug delivery. This article explores the substrate materials, preparation techniques, characterization methods, and current applications of DMNs. We also discuss the current challenges and obstacles faced by DMNs. Finally, we outline potential future research directions for DMNs, aiming to provide a theoretical reference for researchers involved in their preparation and application.}
