abstract = {Nowadays, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has posed a global threat to public health. However, the deployment of alternative antibiotics is lagging far behind the fast evolving antibiotic resistance, which demands effective strategies to restore drug-resistance sensitivity to available antibiotics. Here, a well-known antitumor lipoprotein complex consisted of bovine α-lactalbumin and oleic acid (BAMLET) was electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of mesoporous silica nanomaterials (MSN), forming an antibiotic adjuvant to re-sensitize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to aminoglycoside antibiotics. It was found MSN of distinctive particle size may cause conformational changes of bound lipoprotein complex affecting the bactericidal performance of formed BAMLET@MSN conjugates (BMSN). Moreover, MSN was loaded with curcumin to endow obtained BMSN improved bioavailability and antioxidant capacity. The mechanistic studies revealed that antibacterial activities of BMSN originated from bacterial cell membrane disruption and biofilm inhibition, which promoted antibiotic entry and restored antibiotic bactericidal efficacy in the cell. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of MRSA indicated that BMSN interfered with bacterial amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate synthesis, and ATP translocation in bacteria. Therefore, the constructed BMSN/curcumin as potent antibiotic adjuvant provided a manipulable nanoplatform to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis.}
