abstract = {Herein, we constructed a near-infrared (NIR) responsive CuS/CuO2 cascade nanozyme system addressing the critical limitation of exogenous H2O2 dependency in conventional therapies. This system incorporates NIR-responsive antibacterial CuS/CuO2 composite based on cascade nanoenzymes. The loaded CuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) spontaneously generate Cu2+ and H2O2 in situ upon NIR irradiation (808 nm). This initiates a dual catalytic pathway: (1) Cu2+-mediated Fenton-like reactions and (2) H2O2-activated peroxidase-like activity, synergistically producing ·OH radicals (EPR-confirmed). Under NIR irradiation, CuO2 releases H2O2 that activates the peroxidase-like activity of CuS. During the following cascade reaction, Cu2+ catalyzes a Fenton-like reaction to produce a large amount of ·OH, while H2O2 activates peroxidase-like activity in the CuS/CuO2 composite. Additionally, CuS/CuO2 also exhibits oxidase-like activity. The oxidase-like activity coupled with the cascade reaction simulated with photothermal conditions allows CuS/CuO2 (100 μg/mL) to effectively destroy Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Moreover, the CuS/CuO2 composite effectively inhibits the formation of biofilms of E. coli, S. aureus, and MRSA. ·OH was confirmed to be the main free radical during the antimicrobial process of CuS/CuO2. In vivo anti-infection assays prove that CuS/CuO2 could accelerate wound healing under NIR irradiation with negligible toxicity. This self-sustaining system eliminates exogenous H2O2 requirements while achieving combinatorial antimicrobial efficacy through photothermal-potentiated nanozyme cascades.}
