abstract = {Developing stable, effective, and processable bactericidal materials is an important challenge in combating bacterial infections in various biomedical and environmental fields. Hyper-crosslinked hollow porous nanospheres (HHPNs) have attracted increasing attention as control and release medium for insoluble and unstable drugs due to transmit properties original from their adjustable pore structure and surface functionality. However, to assemble hollow porous spheres is complicated while difficult to use in applications due to their powdery nature. To broaden the usability of powdered polymers, an approach that integrates a bottom-up self-assembly strategy with top-down electrospinning was introduced, allowing for the efficient fabrication of nanofibrous membranes from self-assembled HHPNs. The HHPNs were synthesized via an one-step Friedel−Crafts reaction without templating methods, yielding customizable pore structures with high antibacterial agent loading capacities. Resveratrol (Res) loaded HHPNs were further processed into polycaprolactone nanofibrous membranes (Res@HHPNs/PCL NFMs) by electrospinning, which exhibited sustainable antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). In vivo experiments indicated that these antimicrobial and antioxidant NFMs promoted wound healing by reducing the expression of inflammatory factors (including IL-1β and TNF-α) and enhancing angiogenesis at the wound site. In conclusion, the Res@HHPNs/PCL NFMs are user-friendly, dual functionality, and their recycling process effectively prevents secondary environmental pollution. This study highlights the utility of HHPNs for preparing NFMs and provides a new avenue for the potential development of antimicrobial membranes in biomedical and environmental fields.}
