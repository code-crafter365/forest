abstract = {The degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has garnered notable attention owing to its widespread accumulation and the challenges associated with its breakdown. Herein, the enzyme mimics with PET-hydrolytic activity were developed by combining peptide nanofibers with graphene oxide (GO). Inspired by native enzymes, we designed self-assembled peptides that included active amino acids (serine, histidine, aspartate and tryptophan) and different hydrophobic amino acids, with a 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group at the N-terminus. Our comparison of hydrophobic amino acids revealed that their content not only influenced the higher-order assembly of peptide but also affected molecular conformation and PET degradation ability. By co-assembling two peptides with catalytic and binding sites in a 1:1 ratio, a more effective active enzyme mimic was constructed which was owning to the cooperative interactions among the active amino acids; in addition, hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions were the main forces in enhancing catalytic effects. To further improve PET-hydrolytic ability, the co-assembled enzyme mimic was functionalised with GO through π–π stacking. This GO-peptide nanofiber hybrid exhibited increased PET-hydrolytic, as GO provided a hydrophobic microenvironment for substrate attraction and abundant carbon for facilitating proton transfer. The GO-peptide nanofiber hybrid as enzyme mimics will be a promising material for PET degradation.}
