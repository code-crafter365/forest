Customized titanium implants are commonly used for repairing mandibular defects caused by accidents. However, the semi-open nature of the oral environment increases the likelihood of inflammation around the implant, which has a significant impact on the therapeutic outcomes. Most existing research tackles this issue by achieving drug loading through surface modifications to create local drug delivery systems. Nevertheless, several technical challenges remain in constructing effective local drug delivery systems based on the implant structure. In this study, a titanium drug reservoir was designed and fabricated, incorporating laser grid texturing and silicone oil heat treatment. The droplet capture mechanism was analyzed, and the effect of the sustainable release area on droplet motion resistance was evaluated. In vitro antibacterial tests revealed that the modified drug reservoir, characterized by high adhesion and superhydrophobicity, exhibited the most effective sustained release. It had a texturing interval of 500 µm, and the duration of the zone of inhibition was 60 h. This approach presents a new method for fabricating titanium implants integrated with local drug delivery systems, offering significant potential for improved clinical outcomes.}
