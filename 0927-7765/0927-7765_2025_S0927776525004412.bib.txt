abstract = {Cholesterol, a key structural component of mammalian cell membranes, is crucial in stabilizing the membrane and regulating its biophysical properties. Herein, the self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) around differently charged lipid monolayers modulated by cholesterol has been investigated using surface pressure-area isotherms and synchrotron-based X-ray reflectivity. In pristine lipid monolayers, electrostatic interactions control the self-assembly of GO nano-flakes around the lipid molecules. However, upon the addition of cholesterol, the adsorption and penetration kinetics of GO nano-flakes into the lipid monolayers are drastically amplified, irrespective of the ionic nature of lipids. The experimental observations are discussed in terms of interactions occurring among GO nano-flakes, phospholipids, and cholesterol molecules.}
