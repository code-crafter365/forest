abstract = {The application of bioluminescent luciferin-luciferase systems for visualizing and stimulating various processes in living systems is of great interest due to its specific nature and high signal-to-noise ratio. Nanomaterials can finely manipulate multiple parameters of the bioluminescent systems, including the enzyme stability, intensity, and duration of the irradiation. Also, bioluminescence can affect the properties of a nanomaterial, namely, to carry out BRET, to trigger cascades of various photochemical transformations. Here we summarize cases of the interplay between nanomaterials and various bioluminescent systems to improve various biosensors, biovisualization in cellulo, in vivo, and for therapy over the past twenty years. We reviewed interactions between a wide range of nanomaterials and bioluminescent systems, including bacterial and genetically encoded luciferases. This review aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for developing bioluminescent multimodal nanoplatforms for analytic applications and therapy.}
