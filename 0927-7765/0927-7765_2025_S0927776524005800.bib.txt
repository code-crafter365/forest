abstract = {Biological barriers in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) prevent oral absorption of insoluble drugs. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of various nanoparticles (NPs) designed to enhance the efficacy of oral drugs. However, the mechanism underlying the intracellular transport of NPs remains unclear, and there are still limitations to improving the oral bioavailability of drugs. This article reviews the challenges faced in the absorption of oral NPs, proposes strategies to overcome these barriers, and discusses the future prospects.}
