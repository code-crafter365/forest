abstract = {Abnormal cell growth and proliferation can lead to tumor formation and cancer, one of the most fatal diseases worldwide. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has emerged as a cancer biomarker, with its concentration being crucial for distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells. Herein, a cost-effective and enzymeless electrochemical sensing system for the monitoring of intracellular H2O2 has been constructed. The sensor is fabricated using gold nanoparticles embedded bimetallic copper/nickel metal organic framework (Au-CNMOF) immobilized reduced graphene oxide (RGO) modified screen printed electrode (SPE). The synthesized materials were characterized and confirmed by XRD, FTIR, SEM with EDS, and electrochemical analysis. The fabricated sensor displayed a redox peak at a formal potential (E°) of −0.155 V, corresponding to CuII/I redox couple of CNMOF in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Electrochemical investigations revealed that the proposed sensor has a large electrochemical active surface area (1.113 cm2) and a higher surface roughness (5.67). Additionally, the sensor demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 at −0.3 V, over a wide linear detection range from 28.5 µM to 4.564 mM with a limit of detection of 4.2 µM (S/N=3). Furthermore, the proposed sensor exhibits excellent stability, repeatability, reproducibility, and good anti-interference activity. Ultimately, the sensor was validated through real-time analysis of H2O2 released from cancer cells, successfully quantifying the released H2O2. The developed sensor holds great promise for real-time H2O2 analysis, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, biological research and environmental monitoring.}
