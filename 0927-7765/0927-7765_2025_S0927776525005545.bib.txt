abstract = {Functionalized nanoparticles offer a versatile nanomedicine platform for engineering stimulus-responsive, theranostic drug delivery systems to enhance tumor diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we present the development of a stimulus-responsive Fe₃O₄@AuNR nanotherapeutic platform functionalized with anti-PD-L1, which enables antibody and dual drug loading, tumor-specific controlled release, image-guided combination therapy, and synergistic enhancement of antitumor efficacy. As a biomarker of senescence and tumor progression, β-galactosidase enables 5-FUR-β-Gal prodrug activation, contributing to targeted therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer. The anti-PD-L1-functionalized Fe₃O₄@AuNR drug delivery system combines chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and photothermal therapy, while simultaneously enabling fluorescence imaging and MRI of tumor tissues, thus providing a synergistic theranostic platform with promising clinical applicability.}
