abstract = {Unlike traditional drug carriers, sequential drug delivery systems can release different drugs in order, with the first released drug providing a prerequisite for the later released drug to maximize its function, thereby achieving stronger anti-tumor effects. Herein we constructed a temporal sequential system designated TPZ@MSN/HIF-1α siRNA@PDA@GOx (MTRPG) in which mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used as cores to load hypoxia induced chemotherapy drug tirapazamine (TPZ) and gene targeted nucleic acid drug HIF-1α siRNA, polydopamine (PDA) as acid –responsive coating as well as to realize photothermal therapy, and glucose oxidase (GOx) as the outermost layer to achieve starvation therapy and construct a deepened hypoxia to activate TPZ. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that the first released glucose oxidase catalyzed the oxidation of glucose, achieving starvation treatment while reducing the acidic environment and further exacerbating hypoxia in tumor cells. The reduced acidic conditions enabled the degradation of PDA, resulting in the release of loaded HIF-1α siRNA and TPZ. At the same time, PDA could also exert photothermal therapy under 808 nm near-infrared (808 nm NIR) laser irradiation. The later released hypoxia induced chemotherapy drug TPZ amplifies its anti-tumor activity under intensified hypoxia conditions. Meanwhile, the released HIF-1α siRNA interfered with the up-regulated HIF-1α induced by the deepened hypoxia condition, which caused hypoxia tolerance in tumors, reduced its expression activity, and achieved synergistic killing of tumor cells with chemotherapy. This work provides an effective multimodal synergistic therapy strategy to promote tumor therapeutic index, which may possess a promising future in clinical application.}
