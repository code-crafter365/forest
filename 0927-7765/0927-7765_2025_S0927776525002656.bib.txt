abstract = {Antibiotic resistance poses a major challenge to modern healthcare and requires innovative microbial control strategies. Here, we report a novel method for integrating aluminum-doped copper sulfide (CuS@Al) microspheres into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix by electrospinning to obtain multifunctional nanofiber membranes with both photothermal and photodynamic antimicrobial properties (PVA-CuS@Al). Based on the rational design of Al doping to form structural defects on CuS microspheres, the light absorption and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly enhanced. Under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation (808 nm, 2.0 W/cm²), PVA-CuS@Al with 5 wt% CuS@Al achieved rapid temperature rise from 25 °C to 181 °C within 15 s, and complete inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was achieved within 10 min by photothermal ablation. In addition, under simulated sunlight, the membrane effectively generates ROS, achieving 100 % bacterial inhibition through photodynamic effects. The performance of the material goes beyond previous studies by combining dual antibacterial mechanisms on a single platform, reducing the required additive concentration (3 wt% CuS@Al), while maintaining biocompatibility and blood compatibility. This work introduces the development strategy of a new generation of antibacterial wound dressing with high efficiency and low cytotoxicity.}
