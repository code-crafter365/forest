abstract = {This study mainly focused on the synthesis of multi-metal selenides over functionalized carbon nanotubes (Cu2MnSe2@CNTs) via hydrothermal method and used as a bifunctional material against photocatalytic removal of organic dyes and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains eradication. Comprehensive analysis involves various techniques including FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX and UV-Vis spectroscopy. FT-IR, XRD, and SEM studies revealed the successful incorporation of Cu2MnSe2 nano-cubes on CNTs surface exhibited the morphology. Prepared composite was tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and L. monocytogenes via disk diffusion method which evidenced higher inhibition zone 23 and 26 mm with minimal composite loading. Cu2MnSe2@CNTs exhibited superior photocatalytic efficiency achieving 92 % degradation of Methyl Orange (MO) and Rhodamine B in just 32 and 40 min respectively. Kinetic studies revealed first order kinetics with rate constant values of 0.1167 and 0.0976 min-1 for MO and Rhodamine B degradation. With multiple benefits including wastewater treatment and antibacterial activities essential for improving water quality health improvement could advancing the industrial-scale synthesis of reported materials. So, this research plays a crucial role in the development of eco-friendly and practically applied composites materials in the realm of environmental remediations.}
