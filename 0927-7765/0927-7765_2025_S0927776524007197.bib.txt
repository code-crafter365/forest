abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) shows promise in treating myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI), but the challenge of controlled and sustained release hinders its clinical utility. In this study, we developed a platelet membrane-encapsulated mesoporous silica nanoparticle loaded with the H2S donor diallyl trisulfide (PM-MSN-DATS). PM-MSN-DATS demonstrated optimal encapsulation efficiency and drug-loading content. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo assessments confirmed the biosafety of PM-MSN-DATS. In vitro, PM-MSN-DATS adhered to inflammation-activated endothelial cells and exhibited targeted accumulation in MIRI rat hearts. In vivo experiments revealed significant reductions in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myocardial fibrosis area, improving cardiac function. Our findings highlight successfully creating a targeted H2S delivery system through platelet membrane-coated MSN nanoparticles. This well-designed drug delivery platform holds significant promise for advancing MIRI treatment strategies.}
