abstract = {In the current study we fabricated potent materials by incorporating therapeutic elements into calcium phosphates (CPs) to combat cancer. This involved synthesizing manganese (Mn)- and lithium (Li)-doped CPs and loading them into electrospun nanofibers (NFs) composed of chitosan (CS) and polyethylene oxide (PEO). The characterized CPs exhibited excellent properties, including a particle size of 47–75 nm, surface charge of –(30−56) mV, and specific surface area of 75–266 m2/g. The electrochemical analysis revealed that Mn and Mn/Li-doped CPs are promising for generating oxygen free radicals and H2O2, crucial for cancer therapy. Biological evaluation showcased the outstanding performance of the developed materials. MTT assay revealed a cytotoxic effect of nano-constructs on melanoma A375 cell line without adverse effects on normal L929 cells over 72 h. Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay indicated substantial apoptosis rates in A375 cells treated with PC-20 % (62.55 ± 4.59 %). The obtained data of qPCR analysis of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes (P53, Bax, Bcl-2) in A375 cells treated with different CP nanoparticles (NPs) showed a significant increase in P53 and Bax gene expression, indicating high levels of A375 cell apoptosis. Additionally, the samples containing Mn ion exhibited high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In conclusion, the fabricated NFs scaffolds hold promising potential for cancer therapy.}
