abstract = {HER2-positive breast cancer constitutes 20 % of reported cases, characterized by excessive expression of HER2 receptors, pivotal in cell signaling and growth. Immunotherapy, the established treatment, often leads to multidrug resistance and tumor recurrence. There's a critical need for an effective strategy delaying drug resistance onset and ensuring cancer cell eradication. This study aimed to develop nanoparticles using human serum albumin (HSA) coupled with vitamin E (α-tocopherol succinate), loaded with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or aromatase inhibitor (AI). Nanoparticles were formed via desolvation, where HSA(VE) conjugates self-organized into a nanoparticle structure, incorporating TKI/AI either through chemical conjugation or direct binding to HSA. Physico-chemical analyses—such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), UV, IR, and CD spectroscopy confirmed HSA(VE) binding and drug incorporation into nanoparticles, evaluating their drug entrapment, release efficiency. Cell viability assays and in-vitro experiments on resistant and sensitive cell lines demonstrated effective drug encapsulation and absorption over time. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that a combination of Lapa@HSA(VE) NPs and Let@HSA(VE) NPs in the ratio 75:25 inhibited tumor development and enhanced apoptosis significantly compared to individual NP treatment and free drug. The combination NPs therapy exhibited significant efficacy even in Lapa-resistant cell lines.}
