abstract = {Quercetin, a flavonoid known for its antioxidant properties, has recently garnered attention as a potential neuroprotective agent for treatment of the injured nervous system. The repair of peripheral nerve injuries hinges on the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells, which play a crucial role in supporting axonal growth and myelination. In this study we synthesized Quercetin-derived carbon dots (QCDs) and investigated their effects on cultured Schwann cells and the NG108-15 cell line. QCDs was obtained by solvothermal synthesis and characterized via UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The particles demonstrated significant dose-dependent free radical scavenging activity in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays, supported in vitro proliferation and migration of Schwann cells, expression of neurotrophic and angiogenic growth factors, and stimulated neurite outgrowth from NG108-15 cells. Thus, QCDs could serve as a potential novel treatment strategy to promote regeneration in the injured peripheral nervous system.}
