abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor-based cancer immunotherapy has demonstrated significant clinical benefits; however, its efficacy in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains limited owing to insufficient T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Notably, therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction or stress pathways can activate innate immunity and promote the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In this study, we developed ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs) mineralized with CaCO3 to construct ZIF-8@CaCO3 NPs, designed to enhance tumor cell damage via dual Zn/Ca ion overload. The ZIF-8@CaCO3 NPs exhibited optimal size distribution, excellent biocompatibility, and the ability to release Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions under mildly acidic conditions, subsequently generating reactive oxygen species. Importantly, an overload of Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions combined with oxidative stress disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis, leading to the release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA. This process stimulated innate immune responses, including a direct anti-tumor effect and the recruitment of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, the released mtDNA enhanced cross-presentation in dendritic cells, further amplifying the anti-tumor immune response. Our findings indicate that ZIF-8@CaCO3 NPs hold great promise for improving immunotherapeutic outcomes in CRC.}
