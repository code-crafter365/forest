abstract = {Wound infections represent a significant clinical challenge. In this study, a polyphenol (tannic acid, TA)-enhanced borate hydrogel modulating the tissue microenvironment to promote wound healing was designed as an antimicrobial hydrogel. The physical properties of the multiply cross-linked borate hydrogel were analyzed using a combination of techniques, including FT-IR, 1H NMR, SEM, and rheological analysis. The combination of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), phenylboronic acid-functionalized chitosan (N-PBACS), and TA resulted in the formation of multi-crosslinked networks (PVA@N-PBACS, TA@PVA, and TA@N-PBACS) that markedly enhanced the hydrogel's mechanical strength, deformability (compression and tensile), and adhesion properties. The multi-crosslinked hydrogels exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and antioxidant effects in vitro, as well as excellent biocompatibility and the promotion of cell proliferation, migration and vascularisation behaviours. The in vivo results demonstrated that the hydrogel had enhanced properties. Furthermore, it exhibits good biocompatibility, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability, antimicrobial properties, and the ability to modulate immune status. In an in vivo bacterial infection model, the multi-crosslinked hydrogel effectively modulated the wound microenvironment through antimicrobial effects, oxidative stress, ROS levels, and immunity modulation. This study offers a promising solution for improving wound care and provides insight into potential future therapeutic strategies.}
