abstract = {This review systematically combed the breakthrough achievements in the field of food active packaging over the past five years, comprehensively analyzed the advantages and limitations of the combination of bioactive agents within safe dosage ranges with six major categories of packaging systems, and deeply explored the interaction mechanisms between bioactive agents and packaging materials in different combinations and their impacts on packaging functions and application effects, so as to provide a scientific basis for the research and development of innovative and efficient active packaging systems. In addition, the review focused on expounding the key technical points in the matching of bioactive agents with specific packaging types and the optimal incorporation strategies of active agents for different food preservation needs. Based on the physicochemical properties of bioactive agents and the functional requirements of active packaging films, this study constructed a systematic selection framework for combination methods to provide a theoretical reference for the precise design and application of active packaging.}
