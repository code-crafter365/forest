abstract = {Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have emerged as versatile nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems that can stimulate systemic immune responses and facilitate precise co-delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. This study introduces a bioengineering approach that enables the co-delivery of the angiogenesis inhibitor Angio-3 and the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) within OMVs, creating a potent antitumor therapeutic platform. Angio-3 displayed on the surface of OMVs inhibited angiogenesis and decreased vascular permeability, which in turn impeded the supply of nutrients necessary for tumor growth. Moreover, intrinsic properties of OMVs triggered a systemic immune response. Both in vitro and in vivo studies, including a CT26 tumor-bearing mouse model, have demonstrated that the OMV@A&D-based therapeutic regimen, which integrates antiangiogenesis, chemotherapy, and immune activation, significantly suppresses tumor proliferation. This study highlights the potential of bioengineered OMVs in revolutionizing cancer therapy by offering a multifaceted and synergistic platform that enhances therapeutic outcomes.}
