abstract = {Simultaneous bone and nerve regeneration is important in facilitating osseointegration. However, regeneration of neural elements is often overlooked when designing orthopedic implants. Since nerves are electroactive tissues that regulate bone formation via neuropeptide release, developing photoelectric coating material on implants is optimal for neural-stimulated osteoblast activation. In this study, three kinds of vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube (TNT) coatings with tube diameter of 60, 110 and 180 nm were fabricated on Ti implants denoting as TNT-60, TNT-110 and TNT-180, respectively. TNT-60 coating with higher oxygen-vacancy concentration and lower crystallinity displayed higher visible-light absorption capacity and transient photocurrent density. Enhanced photoelectric activity of TNT-60 was ascribed to narrowed bandgap of TiO2 and enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. TNTs coatings under visible-light irradiation significantly improved proliferation of PC12 cells and cell differentiation in terms of neurite outgrowth and calcitonin gene-related peptide release. Among them, TNT-60 coating exerted the greatest enhancement via Ca2 + influx mechanism. Osteoblast differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells were significantly enhanced when cells were cultured with conditioned medium from PC12 cells cultured on the TNTs coatings with visible-light illumination. This indicated neural-stimulated osteoblast activation. Above all, photoelectric TNT coating provides a promising approach for targeting nerve activation to stimulate osteogenesis.}
