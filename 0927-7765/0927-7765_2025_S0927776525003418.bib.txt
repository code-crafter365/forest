abstract = {Developing appropriate nanoplatforms with enhanced properties to increase the efficiency of the nano-based strategies is an urgent challenge for cancer therapy. In this work, a S, Pd modified hollow CoNiMnFe Prussian blue analogue nanocomposite (Pd-S-CNMF) was prepared as multifunctional nanoplatform for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided for combined cascade catalyzed therapy and low-temperature photothermal therapy. We found that the co-modification of S and Pd on CNMF could enhance the responsive feature the as-prepared nanocomposite to acidic environment, which endowed the Pd-S-CNMF with multiple enzyme mimicking activities and enhanced NIR light absorption. To construct efficient nanoplatform for prostate cancer therapy, a HSP 90 protein inhibitor, tanespimycin was loaded on Pd-S-CNMF (17Pd-S-CNMF) to inhibit the level of HSP 90 protein, thus increasing the outcome of subsequent photothermal therapy. The constructed 17Pd-S-CNMF is expected to remodel tumor microenvironment (TME), generate sufficient highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia to enhance the efficacy of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). In addition, comparing to the pristine CNMF and S doped CNMF, the as-prepared Pd-S-CNMF possessed superior magnetic TME sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance. Benefiting from these amazing properties, the as-prepared 17Pd-S-CNMF could effectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in vitro and vivo. Our findings provide a paradigm for construction of efficient nanocomposites as nanoplatform for cancer diagnose and treatment.}
