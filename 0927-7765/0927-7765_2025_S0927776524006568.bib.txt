abstract = {Instigating oxidative stress is a crucial aspect of antibacterial therapy. Yet, its behavior is poorly understood in the context of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) – a group of highly promising antibacterial agents. To address this gap, a series of ZIF@Ce6 particles were synthesized to investigate the impact of particle shape, size, and metal ion type on oxidative stress and bactericidal activity. For the first time, the interplay between the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activities of different ZIF@Ce6 particles is demonstrated, while unearthing their oxidative stress strategy in photodynamic therapy. Notably, the incorporation of chlorin e6 (Ce6), combined with light irradiation, amplified the bactericidal effect of the ZIFs and achieved a rare minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 12.5 µgmL−1 for ZIF-8. We discovered that singlet oxygen (1O2) production varies with particle shape and size, while photodynamic activity reshuffles the antibacterial performance sequence from pristine to modified ZIF-8. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and glutathione depletion tests revealed that oxidative stress in pristine ZIF-8 is predominantly induced by ROS, whereas both ROS and glutathione contribute to the oxidative stress in ZIF@Ce6 and pristine ZIF-67. When bacteria are preincubated with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, the bactericidal activity of ZIF@Ce6 increases while the activity of pristine ZIF-8 is reduced and that of ZIF-67 remains unchanged. This study deepens our understanding of the antibacterial properties of ZIFs and their oxidative stress paths, paving way for the fabrication of ZIF-based materials with enriched and targeted antibacterial properties.}
