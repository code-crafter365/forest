abstract = {Tumor metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. There is a strong correlation between tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) density and the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells. This study aimed to develop a tumor-targeting nanomedicine capable of simultaneously delivering a chemotherapeutic agent and a natural ECM crosslinker, to both kill tumor cells and reinforce ECM as a barrier to physically impede metastatic dissemination. We constructed a liposomal nanomedicine (RGD-LNP-DG) co-loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and genipin (GNP), modified with RGD peptides to target integrin αvβ3. RGD-LNP-DG exhibited uniform nanoscale size, pH-sensitive drug release, and excellent tumor targeting. It promoted ECM crosslinking, forming a dense collagen network that inhibited tumor cell migration. In a 4T1 tumor model, RGD-LNP-DG significantly suppressed primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, while prolonging survival without causing notable toxicity. This dual-functional nanomedicine integrates targeted chemotherapy with ECM reinforcement, representing a novel and effective approach to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis through physical microenvironment modulation.}
