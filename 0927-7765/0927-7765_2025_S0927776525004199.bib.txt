abstract = {Flexible sensors have garnered significant research interest as essential components of wearable devices. However, achieving flexible sensors with superior mechanical properties, high sensing performance, and a broad strain range remains challenging. In this study, an ion-conducting N-(2-Amino-2-oxoethyl) acrylamide/carboxymethyl chitosan/methyl cellulose hydrogel was analyzed, and its process parameters were optimized to enable high-fidelity hydrogel printing. Furthermore, a dual-ion synergistic enhancement strategy was proposed, wherein Fe3+ and Li+ were introduced via solution immersion to tailor a “stiff-tough-ductile” balanced network, significantly enhancing the mechanical properties of the hydrogel network. Experimental results showed that the dual-ion-treated hydrogels exhibited outstanding mechanical properties, with a modulus of elasticity of up to 266 kPa, toughness reaching 1245 kJ/m3, elongation at break of up to 437 %, and remarkable resistance to swelling. Additionally, the three-dimensional-printed reticulated hydrogel exhibited high sensitivity, a strain factor of 2.57, a broad detection range (0–300 %), and excellent fatigue durability over 100 cycles at 60 % strain. Integrating hydrogels into flexible sensors enables the high-precision detection of both subtle and large-scale human body movements, thereby advancing the application of conductive hydrogels in wearable electronics and offering new insights for the design and development of flexible sensors.}
