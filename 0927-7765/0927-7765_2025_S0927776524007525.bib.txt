abstract = {Angiogenesis provides essential nutrients and oxygen to tumors during tumorigenesis, facilitating invasion and metastasis. Consequently, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis is an established strategy in anti-cancer therapy. In this study, we engineered a dual-function nanosystem with both antiangiogenic and photodynamic properties. We transformed the hydrophobic photosensitizer zinc phthalocyanine (PS) into a hydrophilic form via protein renaturation, resulting in a novel photosensitizer: Monocyte-Activating Polypeptide-II (EMAP-II:PS@NPs). Characterization through dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV–vis spectroscopy showed that these nanoparticles exhibited uniform size and stability, and enhanced solubility. We further demonstrated that EMAP-II:PS@NPs effectively target tumor vascular endothelia causing intracellular photodynamic cytotoxicity. Notably, EMAP-II:PS@NPs achieved effective ablation of solid tumors at significantly reduced dosages of drugs compared to conventional therapies, due to their potent apoptotic effects on light-exposed cells. This study highlights the potential of combining anti-angiogenic activity with phototherapy, paving the way for innovative cancer treatment strategies.}
