abstract = {Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRs) is involved in the progression of OSF, and miR manipulation could be a promising therapeutic approach. Nanoformulation can protect exogenous miRs against nuclease degradation and enhance cell retention. Accordingly, chitosan (CS), which possesses an anti-fibrotic capacity, is proposed to encapsulate miRs as nanoparticles (NPs) for treating OSF. miR-negative control (miR-NC)/CS NPs were fabricated by an ionic gelation method and characterized. Human oral submucosal fibroblasts were first subjected to arecoline stimulation to induce myofibroblast differentiation and were then transfected with a miR-145 inhibitor or miR-424 inhibitor using CS NPs. For CS NPs loaded with miR-NC, the particle size was 121.9 ± 0.1 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.162 ± 0.004 and zeta potential of + 22.4 ± 0.5 mV. Transfection of these two miRs downregulated mRNA levels of transforming growth factor beta 1, actin alpha 2 smooth muscle, collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), COL3A1, COL4A1, matrix metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 in myofibroblasts. A Western blot analysis revealed that miR/CS NP transfection decreased alpha-smooth muscle actin and type 1 collagen protein products. Furthermore, the wound closure ability of stimulated cells was inhibited upon transfection. In conclusion. CS NPs are a good delivery vehicle for miR transfection. Transfection of a miR-145 inhibitor and miR-424 inhibitor inhibited the TGF-β signaling pathway and decreased ECM component production, and could thus be a promising treatment for OSF.}
