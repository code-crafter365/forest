abstract = {The rampant use of commercial antibiotics not only increases drug resistance but also causes a significant threat to human health. This study assessed the wound healing efficacy of hydrogels crafted from carboxymethyl chitosan (Cmc), polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA), tannic acid (TA), and carbazole (Car), with the aim of expediting the wound healing process. Hydrogels were formulated using Cmc/γ-PGA, Cmc/γ-PGA/TA, and Cmc/γ-PGA/TA/Car, followed by a thorough evaluation of their physicochemical attributes. Additionally, assessments encompassed cytotoxicity, antibacterial efficacy, wound contraction rates, histopathological parameters, immunofluorescent staining of CD31, CD86, and COL1A, along with the determination of serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10. The physicochemical analyses validated the successful synthesis of the hydrogels, which exhibited both safety and potent antibacterial properties. Topical application of Cmc/γ-PGA/TA/Car hydrogels notably accelerated wound contraction, as evidenced by heightened expression of CD31 and COL1A, alongside reduced serum concentrations of IL-1β and IL-6. In essence, the Cmc/γ-PGA/TA/Car hydrogel demonstrated a dual effect of mitigating inflammation and modulating the proliferative phase, that shows their abilities for application in the wound healing process.}
