abstract = {Articular cartilage defects, as a core pathologic feature in the progression of osteoarthritis, and their irreversible degenerative changes lead to functional impairment and socioeconomic burden for tens of millions of patients worldwide. Hydrogels have become key biomaterials in cartilage regeneration with the three-dimensional network structure, programmable mechanical properties, and cell-adaptive microenvironment of biomimetic extracellular matrix. In recent years, several hydrogel systems with in vitro/in vivo repair potential have been developed by modulating the material topology, dynamic mechanical response, and delivery of bioactive factors, and some of them have entered the clinical translation stage. This review systematically explains the biomimetic design principles of hydrogels. It analyzes the immunomodulation and chondrogenic mechanisms mediated by hydrogels, providing a theoretical framework for the development of next-generation smart cartilage repair materials.}
