abstract = {Uncontrolled bleeding from incompressible or irregularly shaped wounds is a major factor in the death of people in the battlefield or surgery process. Ideal rapid hemostatic materials should have the performance of rapid hemostasis and at the same time can be applied to a variety of complex wound trauma types, in addition, excellent antimicrobial properties, adhesion, biocompatibility, degradation, and the non-toxicity of degradation products are also necessary, but there are fewer hemostatic materials that meet these requirements. Herein, we prepared an injectable hemostatic hydrogel based on the natural products sodium alginate (SA) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC). Oxidized sodium alginate (OSA) was prepared by the oxidation reaction of NaIO4 with SA, and OSA with aldehyde group was mixed with CMC with amino group to rapidly form an in situ injectable hemostatic hydrogel (OSA/CMC) by the Schiff base reaction. OSA/CMC hydrogel exhibited excellent antimicrobial and adhesion properties by the Schiff base reaction. In addition, OSA/CMC hydrogel directly activate the endogenous coagulation pathway through the synergistic effect of OSA, CMC to enhance the hemostatic effect. The results of in vivo hemostasis study showed that OSA/CMC hydrogel significantly accelerated hemostasis and reduced blood loss in liver hemorrhage model and tail amputation model. Therefore, OSA/CMC hydrogel is expected to be a potential material in the direction of rapid clinical hemostasis due to its good adhesion properties, antimicrobial properties, biocompatibility, blood compatibility, and efficient rapid hemostasis.}
