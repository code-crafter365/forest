abstract = {Due to the complex regenerative microenvironment after peripheral nerve injury (PNI), developing a piezoelectric/conductive composite nerve guidance conduit (NGC) for repairing nerve defects remains a great challenge. The conductivity and piezoelectricity have been separately demonstrated to enhance the repair of PNI, yet there is a paucity of studies investigating the synergistic effects of both functions. Herein, a piezoelectric/conductive nerve conduit composed of chitosan (CS), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) was fabricated, which provided the conductivity, mechanical support and piezoelectricity. Tensile strength, conductivity, antibacterial activity, and cell viability of piezoelectric/conductive composite NGCs were evaluated. Piezoelectric/conductive composite NGCs exhibited electrical signal output capability and conductive performance. Moreover, rGO significantly promoted cell proliferation and adhesion. Overall, the piezoelectric/conductive CS/rGO/PLLA nerve conduit shows great promise as a potential treatment of PNI.}
