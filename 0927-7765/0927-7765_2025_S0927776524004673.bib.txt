abstract = {Implant-associated infections (IAIs), triggered by pathogenic bacteria, are a leading cause of implant failure. The design of functionalized coatings on biomedical materials is crucial to address IAIs. Herein, a multifunctional coating with good antifouling effect and antibacterial photothermal therapy (aPTT) performance was developed. The copper tannate nanosheets (CuTA NSs) were formed via coordination bonding of Cu2+ ions and tannic acid (TA). The CuTA NSs were then integrated into the TA and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) network to form the TCP coating for deposition on the titanium (Ti) substrates via surface adhesion of TA and gravitational effect. The resulting Ti-TCP substrate exhibited good antifouling property, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability and cytocompatibility. The TCP coating exhibited antifouling efficacy in conjunction with aPTT, curtailing the surface adhesion and biofilm formation of pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Notably, the Ti-TCP substrate also exhibited the ability to prevent bacterial infection in vivo in a subcutaneous implantation model. The present work demonstrated a promising approach in designing high-performance antifouling and photothermal bactericidal coatings to combat IAIs.}
