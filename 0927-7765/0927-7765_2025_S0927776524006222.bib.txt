abstract = {The rational design of nanozymes with highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to overcome the resistant infection microenvironment still faces a significant challenge. Herein, the highly active Fe single-atom nanozymes (Fe SAzymes) with a hierarchically porous nanostructure were prepared through a colloidal silica-induced template method. The proposed Fe SAzymes with satisfactory oxidase (OD)-like and peroxidase (POD)-like activity can transform O2 and H2O2 to superoxide anion free radical (•O2-) and hydroxyl radical (•OH), which possess an excellent bactericidal effect. Also, the glutathione peroxidase (GPX)-like activity of Fe SAzymes can consume glutathione in the infection microenvironment, thus facilitating ROS generation to enhance the sterilization effect. Besides, the intrinsic photothermal effect of Fe SAzymes further significantly boosts the enzyme-like activity to generate much more reactive oxygen species for efficient antibacterial therapy. Accordingly, both in vitro and in vivo results indicate that the Fe SAzymes with synergistically photothermal-catalytic performances exhibit satisfactory antibacterial effects and biocompatibility. This work provides new insights into designing highly efficient SAzymes for effective sterilization applications by an amount of ROS generation.}
