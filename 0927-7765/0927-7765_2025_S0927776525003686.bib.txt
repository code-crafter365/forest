abstract = {Red blood cell (RBC) adhesion plays a pivotal role in vascular physiology and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including diabetes and hypertension. This study aims to elucidate the interplay between sialic acid removal and macromolecular depletion interactions on RBC adhesion using interference reflection microscopy (IRM). The adhesion of RBC to surfaces coated with albumin in the presence of polymers is quantitatively assessed, focusing on how neuraminidase-induced desialylation influences adhesion dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that sialic acid removal significantly enhances RBC adhesion in solutions containing high-molecular-weight dextran, while at the same time, membrane undulations were reduced. No significant increase in the adhesion energies was observed without the presence of polymers. However, in the presence of the depleted polymer, the adhesion energy correlates positively with neuraminidase concentration. This indicates a substantial increase in depletion interaction energy due to the altered cell surface properties and suggests that macromolecular depletion forces might contribute to abnormal RBC adhesion in pathologies associated with reduced surface charge, providing new insights into the biophysical mechanisms of RBC adhesion in health and disease.}
