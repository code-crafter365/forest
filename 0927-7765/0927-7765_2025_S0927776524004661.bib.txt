abstract = {Advancement in the development of new materials with theranostic and phototherapeutic potential along with receptiveness to external stimuli has been persistently inspiring oncology research. Herein, titanium carbide-based MXene quantum dots (FHMQDs) have been synthesized and modified to take advantage of stimuli-responsive behavior and target specificity for breast cancer cells. With a size of around 3 nm, the developed FHMQDs demonstrate high fluorescent emission at around 460 nm. With ∼90 % encapsulation efficiency of doxorubicin (DOX), the developed system also offers rapid DOX release behavior when encountering an acidic pH (5.4). Further, the in vitro assessment of the developed FHMQDs on MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells presents excellent target specificity to cancer cells which was reflected by its high cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Additionally, the outstanding photodynamic efficiency of FHMQDs due to excessive Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generating ability along with apoptosis promoting capability of FHMQDs in cancer cells demonstrates a synergistic approach in cancer theranostics. Encouragingly, the fabricated FHMQDs also exhibited fluorescent labelling and bioimaging capacity which makes it an incredible platform that ensures theranostic excellence in breast cancer research.}
