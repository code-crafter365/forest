abstract = {Titanium (Ti) is an ideal material for dental implants due to its excellent properties. However, corrosion and mechanical wear lead to Ti ions and particles release, triggering inflammatory responses and bone resorption. To overcome these challenges, surface modification techniques are used, including micro-arc oxidation (MAO). MAO creates adherent, porous coatings on Ti implants with diverse chemical compositions. In this context, zirconia element stands out in its wear and corrosion properties associated with low friction and chemical stability. Therefore, we investigated the impact of adding zirconium oxide (ZrO2) to Ti surfaces through MAO, aiming for improved electrochemical and mechanical properties. Additionally, the antimicrobial and modulatory potentials, cytocompatibility, and proteomic profile of surfaces were investigated. Ti discs were divided into four groups: machined – control (cpTi), treated by MAO with 0.04 M KOH – control (KOH), and two experimental groups incorporating ZrO2 at concentrations of 0.04 M and 0.08 M, composing the KOH@Zr4 and KOH@Zr8 groups. KOH@Zr8 showed higher surface porosity and roughness, even distribution of zirconia, formation of crystalline phases like ZrTiO4, and hydrophilicity. ZrO2 groups showed better mechanical performance including higher hardness values, lower wear area and mass loss, and higher friction coefficient under tribological conditions. The formation of a more compact oxide layer was observed, which favors the electrochemical stability of ZrO2 surfaces. Besides not inducing greater biofilm formation, ZrO2 surfaces reduced the load of pathogenic bacteria evidenced by the DNA-DNA checkerboard analysis. ZrO2 surfaces were cytocompatible with pre-osteoblastic cells. The saliva proteomic profile, evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, was slightly changed by zirconia, with more proteins adsorbed. KOH@Zr8 group notably absorbed proteins crucial for implant biological responses, like albumin and fibronectin. Incorporating ZrO2 improved the mechanical and electrochemical behavior of Ti surfaces, as well as modulated biofilm composition and provided suitable biological responses.}
