abstract = {Healing wounds presents a significant challenge due to bacterial biofilm infections and the inherent drug resistance of these biofilms. This report introduces a multifunctional nanoplatform (NPs) designed to combat wound biofilm infections using NIR-II photothermal therapy. The NPs are self-assembled from amphiphilic polymers (AP) to encapsulate photothermal polymers (PT) through classic electrostatic interactions. Importantly, these NPs are electrically neutral, which enhances their ability to penetrate biofilms effectively. Once inside the biofilm, the NPs achieve complete thermal ablation of the biofilm under NIR-II laser irradiation. Additionally, when exposed to laser and the GSH microenvironment, the NPs exhibit strong photothermal effects and self-degradation capabilities. In vitro tests confirm that the NPs have excellent antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In vivo studies demonstrate that the NPs can efficiently clear wound biofilm infections and promote wound healing. Notably, the NPs show superior photothermal effects under NIR-II laser irradiation compared to NIR-I lasers. In summary, the developed NPs serve as an integrated diagnostic and therapeutic nano-antimicrobial agent, offering promising applications for biofilm wound infections and wound healing.}
