abstract = {This study investigates the impact of peptide charge states on strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC)--mediated grafting efficiency on titanium-based substrates. Cationic peptides exhibited superior grafting in a normal aqueous environment due to electrostatic complementarity with negatively charged dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-functionalized surfaces. Anionic peptides required pH modulation to reverse charge disparities, achieving enhanced grafting at lower pH. This pH-tuned strategy enables universal surface functionalization for diverse therapeutic peptides on titanium-based implants.}
