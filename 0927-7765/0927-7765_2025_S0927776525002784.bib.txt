abstract = {Surgical treatment is the primary method for treating malignant melanoma at present. However, tumor recurrence after surgery and difficulty in wound healing remain significant challenges. This study designed and constructed a therapeutic wound dressing by loading polypyrrole (PPy) into human fibroblast growth factor 2 (hFGF2) covalently bonded camelina oil bodies (h-OB) to form Ph-OB. In a postoperative B16F10 melanoma model in C57BL/6 mice, the photothermal properties of PPy were utilized to increase the temperature at the surgical wound site through near-infrared light irradiation, performing photothermal therapy to kill residual tumors and inhibit tumor recurrence. Meanwhile, the release of hFGF2 from the Ph-OB acts on the postoperative wound site, promotes fibroblast proliferation and migration to accelerate wound healing. In summary, the developed Ph-OB not only prevents tumor recurrence but also facilitates the healing of surgery-induced wounds, showing great potential in postoperative cancer treatment.}
