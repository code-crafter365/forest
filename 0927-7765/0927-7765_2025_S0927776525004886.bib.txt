abstract = {Recent advances in multifunctional hydrogels have offered promising strategy for full-thickness wound healing. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to fabricate hydrogels that simultaneously exhibit shear-thinning behavior, adhesive property, self-healing, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity through a green and feasible approach. Herein, we developed a novel non-covalent double network hydrogel through simple mixing of silk fibroin (SF), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and silicotungstic acid (SiW) solutions to promote full-thickness skin wound healing. SF and PVP could associate with SiW to form rigid and flexible cross-linked networks, respectively, enabling an ultrafast gelation process. Owing to the dynamic and reversible interactions among SF, PVP, and SiW, as well as the unique double network structure, the obtained SF@PVP-SiW hydrogel exhibited remarkable shear-thinning behavior, rapid self-healing capability, robust mechanical properties, and strong tissue adhesion. The unique internal composition endowed the SF@PVP-SiW hydrogel with excellent antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. Benefiting from these advantageous characteristics, the SF@PVP-SiW hydrogel significantly promoted tissue regeneration and accelerated wound closure. This study presents an innovative strategy for developing multifunctional hydrogel-based biomaterials for tissue regeneration applications.}
