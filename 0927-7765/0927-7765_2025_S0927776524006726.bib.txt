abstract = {Wound-dressing adhesion is a problem that has not been effectively addressed in the field of wound care for bleeding or burn wounds. Design of low adhesion wound dressing materials by leveraging interfacial behaviors has been an effective solution to this problem. However, previously reported superhydrophobic low adhesion materials either had durability or biocompatibility issue. To bridge this gap, this study presents a durable and biocompatible superhydrophobic low adhesion wound dressing material, which is designed on a normal gauze substrate with biocompatible components using a hybrid coating strategy. Outstanding low adhesion properties have been verified in vivo with bleeding wound or burn wound, with a peeling force that is only 0.3 %-14.5 % of the conventional non-woven gauze. Prepared low adhesion materials can robustly retain their superhydrophobicity and blood-repelling properties against harsh tests. Moreover, their biocompatibility has been confirmed through a series of tests including cell biocompatibility, hemolysis and skin irritation tests. With these demonstrated merits, the durable and biocompatible low adhesion material developed in this study will provide an effective solution to the wound adhesion problem in the practice of wound management.}
