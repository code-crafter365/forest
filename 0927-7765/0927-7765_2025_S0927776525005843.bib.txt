abstract = {Conventional polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-based denture materials are susceptible to colonization and biofilm-formation by Candida species, leading to Candida-associated denture stomatitis (CADS), a recurring fungal infection that affects a large patient population. In this report, we developed a two-step, plasma-initiated surface functionalization approach to covalently bond poly (methacrylic acid) (PMAA) onto denture resins. Various reaction conditions were investigated and the effects of PMAA grafting yields on the physical properties of the resulting denture materials were determined. The presence of PMAA grafted onto the denture materials significantly increased their ability to bind miconazole, one of the most widely used drugs for managing CADS. Two Candida strains, SC5314 and UME6, were used as representative fungal species. Anticandidal drug released from the PMAA-grafted denture materials eradicated SC5314 and inhibited UME6 hyphae formation and growth. Colony forming unit and fluorescence microscopy confirmed that the anticandidal effects lasted 30 days, even after fungal re-inoculation. XTT assay demonstrated high biocompatibility of the modified materials. These findings suggest strong clinical potential of the new surface functionalized denture materials for preventing and managing CADS and other related fungal infections, offering a durable, biocompatible alternative for managing CADS and reducing fungal infections in denture wearers.}
