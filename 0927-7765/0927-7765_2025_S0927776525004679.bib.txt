abstract = {Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) affects approximately one-third of the global population, and conventional treatments often face challenges such as poor absorption and adverse effects. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of Bacteroides ovatus (BO) and its synergistic combination with MIL-101(CuFe) nanozyme for IDA. The results demonstrated that BO significantly enhanced intestinal iron absorption by upregulating the expression of the duodenal iron transporter ZIP14 and ferroportin (Fpn). Concurrently, BO improved iron transport and storage by upregulating the protein expression of hepatic transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and ferritin subunits FTH/L. Furthermore, BO significantly downregulated the protein expression of hepatic hepcidin, thereby maintaining Fpn function. Subsequently, synthesized MIL-101(CuFe) nanozyme, exhibiting prebiotic properties, was found to significantly promote BO growth (by more than 3-fold). The combination of BO and MIL-101(CuFe) formed the CuFeBO "nanozyme-synbiotics", which substantially alleviated IDA by synergistically improving iron absorption (Fpn), transport (TFR1), and storage (FTH/L). In conclusion, this study elucidates the mechanism by which BO and the CuFeBO nanozyme-symbiont effectively alleviate IDA through multi-targeted, precise modulation of iron absorption, transport, and storage pathways. This synergistic strategy successfully overcomes the limitations of low absorption rates and significant side effects associated with conventional iron therapies, providing a crucial theoretical foundation and broad application prospects for developing novel, efficient, and safer treatments for IDA.}
