abstract = {Prolonged exposure of human cells to toxic arsenate leads to significant skin diseases. To date, continuous and ultrasensitive assessments of toxic arsenate in water and human skin cell lines via simple trapping/monitoring technologies are urgently needed. Herein, nanomonitors based on self-organized multi-geode for trapping/monitoring ultra-trace arsenate concentrations (LOD=0.55ppb) in human skin cell lines were fabricated to prevent skin disorders. For the first time, the structural geode-like hierarchy was constructed via layer-by-layer assembly with nano/microscale features of wide pore openings and mesoporous cavities, enabling suitable diffusion, trapping, and binding of toxic arsenate in human skin cell lines. The biocompatible hierarchal geode with inner and outer receptor-functionalized surfaces revealed a fast in-vitro monitoring/trapping of arsenate in human skin cell lines in order of seconds, with a detection limit below the level affecting skin disorders. The nanomonitor's suitability for extracellular/intracellular tracking/monitoring/trapping toxic arsenate in human skin cell lines has been proven significantly under physiological conditions. Findings confirmed the exceptional characteristics of mesoscale geode-like pores for in-vitro trapping/quantifying toxic arsenate in human skin cell lines from the accumulation of carcinogenic toxicants, thus introducing a route for preventing skin disorders.}
