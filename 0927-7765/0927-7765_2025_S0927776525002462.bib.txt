abstract = {Fe3O4 nanoparticles, known for their magnetic targeting capabilities, biocompatibility, and heat generation upon light exposure, have been extensively explored for various therapeutic applications. However, Fe3O4 nanoparticles may agglomerate in the body, which could affect their therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, researchers are exploring various surface modifications and structural designs to reduce agglomeration and enhance activity. We designed a Fe3O4@FPDA@Pt nanozyme, composed of Fe3O4 core covered with flower-like polydopamine (FPDA), and attached with platinum, for photothermal catalytic synergistic cancer therapy. The enzyme-like activity, photothermal performance, and in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of the nanozyme were investigated. Importantly, Fe3O4@FPDA@Pt exhibited robust enzyme-like activity and photothermal performance. In addition, the flower-like structure was easily swallowed by tumor cells, which was conducive to the rapid production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevated heat at the tumor site. The synergy of these two mechanisms can effectively induce tumor cell death. This study demonstrated a novel and facile synthesis method for the nanozyme and highlighted its unique and advantageous structural characteristics for effective cancer treatment.}
