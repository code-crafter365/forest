abstract = {The impaired wound-healing process in diabetic patients poses a significant clinical challenge due to local immune dysregulation and impaired angiogenesis. This study introduces a novel therapeutic approach using an SBMA/GelMA hydrogel loaded with naringenin (NRN) to restore the immune environment and promote angiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The hydrogel, synthesized via photo-crosslinking, exhibits excellent biocompatibility and inherent antibacterial properties, creating an optimal environment for wound healing. By incorporating NRN, a natural compound with therapeutic potential, the hydrogel enables sustained and controlled release of NRN, ensuring prolonged therapeutic effects. In vitro studies showed that the NRN-loaded SBMA/GelMA hydrogel effectively activated PPARα, suppressing the Sting pathway. This led to enhanced M2 macrophage polarization and increased angiogenesis. In vivo experiments with diabetic wound models further validated the hydrogel's therapeutic potential. The hydrogel significantly accelerated wound healing, evidenced by reduced wound size, enhanced re-epithelialization, and increased angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a shift towards an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype within the wound microenvironment. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of wound healing in diabetic conditions and offers new avenues for developing advanced materials for diabetic wound management.}
