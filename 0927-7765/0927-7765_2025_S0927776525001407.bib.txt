abstract = {Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute inflammation of the pancreas, which is considered a prevalent gastrointestinal emergency characterized by rapid progression and significant mortality. Currently available medications primarily serve as adjunctive therapies, yielding suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Consequently, there remains a dearth of specific and efficient treatment modalities for AP. In recent years, nanomedicine-based treatment strategies have exhibited significant potential as drug therapy approaches for pancreatitis. The distinctive features of the AP microenvironment encompass aberrant activation of pancreatic enzymes, oxidative stress induced by elevated reactive oxygen species levels, and excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; these factors offer promising targeted sites for early diagnosis and treatment using nanomedicine. This article comprehensively delineates the pathological microenvironmental characteristics associated with AP while highlighting the application of microenvironment-responsive strategies in nanodrug delivery systems for its treatment, thereby providing insights into future prospects.}
