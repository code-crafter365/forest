abstract = {Continuous fermentation processes increasingly emphasized cell recycling, utilization, and renewal. In this study, to improve the sustainability of the immobilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cells were recovered on the surface of the glucose-responsive supports through manipulating the competitive interactions of phenylboric acid groups between glycoproteins on the cells and glucose. Through a dopamine (DA)-assisted deposition approach, 3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid (APBA) was integrated to design the saccharide-sensitive cotton fibers (APBA@PDA-CF). The optimal co-deposition time (5 h) and ratio (1:1) resulted in an impressive immobilization efficiency of 69.64%. Meanwhile, 93.23% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was captured and harvested on the surface of APBA@PDA-CF with the fermentation course through regulating the competitive interactions of phenylboric acid groups between glycoproteins on the cells and glucose regardless of pH. Notably, a strong interaction between the yeast cells and APBA@PDA-CF was observed at a low glucose concentration (0.1～2 g/L), with reduced sensitivity at high glucose concentrations (>5 g/L). Moreover, the ethanol production and yield could be increased to 25.37 g/L and 42.4% in the fifth-batch fermentation, respectively. Therefore, based on the feasible and versatile co-deposition method, this study not only broadened the application scope of APBA, but also explored the broad prospects of smart materials in cell immobilization, recovery and continuous fermentation.}
