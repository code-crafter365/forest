abstract = {Creating synthetic interface from non-life materials to improve Shewanella stability and endow them with precise functionalities could revolutionize cell-based biotechnologies. Herein, a stable and cytoprotective biointerface on Shewanella surface are rapidly generated through immediate coordination complexes of TA and Fe (Ⅲ) ions. TA-FeⅢ-based biointerface engineered Shewanella cells can be endowed with extremophile properties of resistance to high temperature, osmotic stress, UV light and lysozyme, and can be released from TA-FeⅢ biointerface through the acidic condition-triggered decomplexation. Furthermore, various functional materials with abiotic properties like conductivity and magnetism can be induced onto surface of Shewanella through co-self-assembly with TA-FeⅢ interface.}
