abstract = {Repairing bone defects in the craniomaxillofacial region remains a significant challenge in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is an emerging customizable bone replacement material for clinical treatment; however, the clinical application of three-dimensional (3D)-printed PEEK is limited by its poor cell adhesion ability and bioinertness. In this study, the cell adhesion ability and osteogenic properties of 3D-printed PEEK were improved by modifying its surface properties. First, methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel containing β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) was prepared and the appropriate β-TCP concentration was determined. Subsequently, sulfonation treatment was used to modify the surface of 3D-printed PEEK, which allowed the stable attachment of the GelMA hydrogel. Thus, 3D-printed bioactive PEEK was prepared successfully. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the 3D-printed bioactive PEEK increased the adhesion to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and osteogenic induction, which improved the cell adhesion and bone repair ability compared to unmodified 3D-printed PEEK. In summary, this study achieved bioactive modification of 3D-printed PEEK through a facile surface modification technique, which provides a new approach for future material design in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.}
