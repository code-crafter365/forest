abstract = {Theranostic nanomedicines have garnered significant attention in cancer management. However, they have yet to achieve clinical transformation due to a lack of precise structure and tumor selectivity. Herein, this work highlights the successful development of a pH-triggered dynamic small molecule nanodrug for targeted tumor theranostics, constructed through self-assembly of orthoester-linked 2,3,5-iodobenzoic acid dimers and doxorubicin by the O/W emulsion solvent evaporation method. The nanodrug exhibits favorable characteristics such as simple preparation, well-defined structure, and high drug loading capacity. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior dynamic alterations in physicochemical properties such as small-to-large size transition, progressive amino protonation and selective drug release across physiological pH (7.4) to tumoral extracellular pH (6.5) and intracellular pH (5.0) levels. These features result in long-term storage stability and circulation longevity while enhancing tumor accumulation by intravenous administration for targeted CT imaging along with significant inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, the pH-triggered small molecule dynamic theranostic nanodrug mediates selective tumor CT imaging and chemotherapy, significantly advancing its potential for clinical application.}
