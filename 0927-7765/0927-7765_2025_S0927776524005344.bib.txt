abstract = {Collagen-based skincare products can replenish collagen in the skin; however, collagen cannot easily penetrate the dermis, limiting its effectiveness. Therefore, nanomaterials that can enable collagen to effectively penetrate the dermis are urgently needed. This study aimed to determine the potential role of the supramolecular collagen nanoparticles, namely, lactoferrin, recombinant human collagen, and palmitoyl tripeptide-5, in improving the effectiveness of skincare products. Lactoferrin and recombinant collagen served as carriers encapsulating palmitoyl tripeptide-5, with an encapsulation rate of 94.18 %. The supramolecular collagen nanoparticles demonstrated good stability after 1 month. Transdermal efficiency was improved by 69.90 %, allowing the nanoparticles to penetrate deeply into the dermis. Within 28 days of use, the moisture content of the stratum corneum increased by 10.51 %, facial elasticity improved by 8.15 %, skin firmness increased by 12.53 %, facial melanin index decreased by 1.84 %, and individual type angle increased by 19.10 %. Within 14 days, there was a 24.69 % reduction in eye bag wrinkles and a 37.61 % reduction in nasolabial wrinkles. Wrinkle lengths decreased by 10.22 % and 21.57 %, and areas decreased by 34.41 % and 27.92 %, respectively. The supramolecular collagen nanoparticles displayed multiple skincare benefits, including moisturizing, whitening, wrinkle reduction, and firming. In conclusion, the supramolecular collagen nanoparticles are promising candidates for cosmetic products.}
