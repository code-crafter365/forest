abstract = {Conventional cotton fiber hemostatic bandages need to passively absorb a large amount of blood due to their high hydrophilicity, resulting in prolonged hemostasis time and increased susceptibility to infection, thereby impeding wound healing. Hence, it is imperative to develop novel hemostatic bandages that can promptly blood clotting while facilitating wound healing. Here a multifunctional composite hemostatic bandage (PSPC) was prepared through in-situ growth technology to anchor silica nanoparticles (SNP) on the polydopamine (PDA) coated chitosan non-woven fabric (CSNF) and combined with polyphosphate (PP). The strong adhesion ability of PDA ensures robust attachment of SNP to the surface of CSNF, thereby significantly reducing particle shedding rate. The PSPC bandage possessed good flexibility, breathability, and mechanical properties, as well as high cytocompatibility and antibacterial properties. Moreover, the synergistic interplay of its multifunctional components promotes rapid blood cell aggregation and actively accelerates the coagulation cascade, significantly enhancing hemostatic performance. In both rat liver and femoral artery injury models, the PSPC exhibited hemostatic efficacy comparable to that of the commercial QuickClot Combat Gauze® bandage. Furthermore, the PSPC demonstrated significant efficacy in promoting full-thickness wound healing. These findings suggested the developed hemostatic bandage holds potential for emergency medical applications in resource-limited settings, including battlefield and remote areas.}
