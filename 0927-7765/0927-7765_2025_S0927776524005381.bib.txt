abstract = {Sorafenib (SOR), a multi-kinase inhibitor for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has limited clinical application due to severe side effects and drug resistance. To overcome these challenges, we developed a bismuth-based nanomaterial (BOS) for thermal injury-assisted continuous targeted therapy in HCC. Initially, the mesoporous nanomaterial was loaded with SOR, forming the BOS@SOR nano-carrier system for drug delivery and controlled release. Notably, compared to targeted or photothermal therapy alone, the combination therapy using this nano-carrier system significantly impaired cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In vivo efficacy evaluations demonstrated that BOS@SOR exhibited excellent biocompatibility, confirmed through hemolysis and biochemical analyses. Additionally, BOS@SOR enhanced contrast in computed tomography, aiding in the precise identification of HCC size and location. The photothermal therapeutic properties of bismuth further contributed to the synergistic anti-tumor activity of BOS@SOR, significantly reducing tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft HCC model. Taken together, encapsulating SOR within a bismuth-based mesoporous nanomaterial creates a multifunctional and environmentally stable nanocomposite (BOS@SOR), enhancing the therapeutic effect of SOR and presenting an effective strategy for HCC treatment.}
