abstract = {Curcumin (CUR) has gained considerable attention in oncology due to its potent anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. However, its clinical utility was significantly hindered by low bioavailability and rapid metabolic degradation. This work designed a magnetic α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterogeneous nanorod prepared via a urea hydrolysis-calcination process for curcumin delivery. The nanorods were modified with hyaluronic acid (HA), providing a stable matrix for curcumin encapsulation. The zeta potential of α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR was −3.94 mV, the saturation magnetization was 7.82 emu·g−1, the encapsulation rate and drug loading rate were 10.53 % and 29.64 % respectively. At pH 5.4, 6.5, and 7.4, the release rates were 44.8 %, 40.2 %, and 39.3 %, respectively. Kinetic modeling indicated that release profiles followed the Weibull kinetic model, with an R2 value greater than 0.98. The α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR exhibited excellent magnetic responsiveness, demonstrating a significant inhibitory effect on human liver cancer (HepG2) cells (inhibition rate greater than 60 %) under a magnetic field. Moreover, they substantially reduced the cytotoxicity of curcumin on normal human (LO2) cells. The α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR inhibited migration and proliferation of HepG2 cells, induced apoptosis via the Caspase pathway, and synergistically suppressed tumor cell development through ferroptosis. The drug release from the α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4/HA/CUR was stable, significantly enhancing the bioavailability of curcumin. This provided a promising strategy for improving the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs and enhancing liver cancer treatment outcomes.}
