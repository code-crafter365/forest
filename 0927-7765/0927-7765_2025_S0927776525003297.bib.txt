abstract = {As a promising anticancer modality, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is becoming popular with the cooperative services of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). In this review, a comprehensive observation about the COFs-mediated SDT is preached by focusing on the fast-track advances in the cancer treatments. Here, the review not only systematically shows the theranostic applications of COFs-based nanodrugs, but also deeply describes the COFs-mediated SDT according to the Type-I and Type-II activation mechanisms. More importantly, the review hierarchically narrates many successes in the COFs-coordinated multimodal SDT/X platforms, highlighting their competitive superiority and improvements in the anticancer applications. In addition, the review also proposes some possible challenges of COFs-mediated SDT strategies. Accordingly, the development of COFs and SDT in the anticancer platform will promote the technological innovation of nanodrugs and facilitate the close exchange of cancer-related events.}
