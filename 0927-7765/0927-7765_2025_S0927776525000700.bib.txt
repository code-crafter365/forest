abstract = {One of the hallmarks of cancer is the acidic extracellular space surrounding the tumor, which is linked to metabolic reprogramming and the use of glycolysis. Additionally, the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) establishes a physiological barrier called "ion trapping" and significantly lowers the ability of cells to absorb weak-base chemotherapy agents. Although CO32- containing agents and nanoformulations could effectively neutralize the tumor acidity, the CO32- based therapeutic effect was insufficiently investigated. Herein, we fabricated cobalt carbonate (CoCO3) nanorods as drug carriers with acidity-responsive dissociation and acidity neutralization properties for the loading of hydrophobic and weak-basic drugs, evodiamine (EVO). After effective surface modification, CoCO3-PEG-EVO could effectively accumulate in the tumor and inhibit the growth of the tumor. On the one hand, acidity neutralization of CoCO3-PEG-EVO could lead to the ion trapping overcome and cellular uptake of EVO enhancement for effective cancer cell apoptosis. On the other hand, the high level of H2O2 in the tumor and HCO3- from dissociated CoCO3-PEG-EVO could cause the generation of CO3·- through a Fenton-like reaction while not hydroxyl radical (·OH) for cancer cell necrosis. Our results thus point to a potent yet easily prepared CoCO3 nanosystem (CoCO3-PEG-EVO) to induce cancer cell death, and because of its well-defined composition and excellent biocompatibility, it may be used in clinical settings in the future.}
