abstract = {Orthogonal multimodal therapy is a highly effective strategy for tumor ablation, yet they require nanomedicines with complex structures that are difficult to use practically. Here, a structurally simple nanomedicine is constructed by independently modified boron-doped carbon quantum dots (B-CDs) with nicorandil by physical absorption and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) through borate ester bonding, respectively. In the redox-imbalance tumor microenvironment, nicorandil (NIC) produce NO for gas therapy in response to intratumoral GSH and HSP90 is inhibited due to H2O2-triggered EGCG release, while B-CDs generate local hyperthermia under near-infrared light. Therefore, this nanomedicine can exercise specific therapeutic modes in response to different tumor microenvironmental characteristics or external stimuli under fluorescence supervision.}
