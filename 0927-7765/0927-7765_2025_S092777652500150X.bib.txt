abstract = {An unstable electrode-neural tissue interface induced by tissue inflammatory response hinders the application of invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In this work, nanosilica cross-linked polyurethane (SiO2/PU) hybrid hydrogels were prepared to serve as the coatings and to modify silicone rubber (SR), which is a commonly used encapsulation material of invasive electrodes for neural recording/stimulation. The hydrophilicity, swelling ratio, and bulk ionic conductivity of SiO2/PU hybrid hydrogels were tailored by incorporating different amount of SiO2 serving as the cross-linking agent. Correspondingly, the optimized SiO2/PU hybrid hydrogel coatings have less impact on the electrochemical properties of invasive electrodes relative to PU hydrogel. Cell affinity assays with rat pheochromocytoma cells reveal that coatings made of SiO2/PU hybrid hydrogels are more effective in enhancing their adhesion and neurite outgrowth than those made of PU hydrogels. The adsorption amount of non-specific proteins on SR is significantly reduced by 81.6 % and 92.6 % upon coating with PU hydrogels and SiO2/PU hybrid hydrogels, respectively. Histological assessment indicates that the SR implants with a SiO2/PU hybrid hydrogel coating provoke the mildest tissue response. Collectively, the SiO2/PU hybrid hydrogel is highly promising for the stabilization of electrode-neural tissue interface, which is crucial for the development of invasive BCIs.}
