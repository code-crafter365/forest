abstract = {Conventional chemotherapy drugs are difficult to effectively target tumor tissue, leading to poor treatment outcomes and side effects. Actively targeted and stimuli-responsive nanomedicine greatly improves this situation, allowing for more precise drug accumulation at tumor sites. Herein, carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin (CMCD) - based host-guest nanocomposites (NPs) encapsulating hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) were fabricated, which responded to esterase and had the function of targeting CD 44 receptors and the nucleus. PS-CMCD was firstly synthesized through an amide reaction of protamine (PS) and CMCD to enhance the function of penetrating membrane and nuclear localization. PS-CMCD/HCPT/HA NPs were then prepared by the host-guest complexation of PS-CMCD and HCPT and followed by surface modification of hyaluronic acid (HA) with CD44 receptor-targeting properties. The successful inclusion was also validated through computer simulation. The obtained nanocomposites displayed the esterase-responsive release behaviors of HCPT. Moreover, the synthesized PS-CMCD/HCPT/HA NPs enhanced the intracellular drug uptake due to the tumor cell- and nuclear-mediated targeting. In addition, in vivo application exhibited that PS-CMCD/HCPT/HA NPs realized good antitumor effects. These findings suggested its potential for targeted delivery and more effective tumor therapy.}
