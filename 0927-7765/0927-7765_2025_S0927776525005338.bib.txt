abstract = {Surfactants are essential ingredients in detergents and personal care products due to their ability to emulsify oils, lower surface tension, and facilitate cleansing. However, increasing evidence links surfactant exposure to adverse effects on human skin, such as lipid disruption, protein denaturation, and inflammatory responses. This review synthesizes recent interdisciplinary research on surfactant chemistry, critical micelle concentration (CMC), and dermal interactions, with a particular focus on their biophysical behavior, cytotoxicity, and irritation potential. We examined both in vitro and in vivo models, including transepidermal water loss (TEWL), cytokine release, and patch testing. Special attention is given to molecular dynamics studies, surfactant-protein interactions, and micellar behavior at biological interfaces. Findings reveal that surfactant structure, especially head group charge, micelle size, and ethoxylation degree critically governs their skin compatibility. Anionic surfactants such as SLS and LAS are strongly irritating, while amphoteric and nonionic types exhibit better dermal tolerance. Polymeric and biobased surfactants show promise in mitigating barrier disruption. Additionally, age-dependent and condition-specific responses indicate heightened vulnerability in neonatal and atopic skin. Innovations such as thermoresponsive surfactants, amino-acid-based systems, and surfactant-polymer complexes are emerging as safer alternatives. The review highlights key mechanistic pathways through which surfactants compromise skin integrity and underscores the need for safer formulations, particularly in light of increased hand hygiene practices. It also identifies design strategies, such as micelle engineering and molecular packing control that can balance cleansing efficacy with biocompatibility. This integrated perspective supports the development of next-generation dermatological and cosmetic products aligned with both performance and safety standards}
