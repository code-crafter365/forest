abstract = {The chitosan-viscose-polyester composite nonwoven (CS-VIS-PET) was successfully prepared by needle-punching, which exhibited a unidirectional liquid transport property. Then, the extract of Cirsium japonicum DC (CJDC) was sprayed on the CS-layer of the CS-VIS-PET (CJDC@CS-VIS-PET) to improve the antibacterial, anti-oxidation, and hemostatic properties. With 10 % drug-loaded, the 10 %CJDC@CS-VIS-PET represented a high antioxidant rate (87.3 %), and the antibacterial rate against E. coli and S. aureus was 99.5 % and 99.7 %, respectively. Due to the synergistic mechanism of the blood capture effect of the CS-layer, the blood concentration effect of the VIS-layer, the blood expulsion effect of the PET-layer, and the chemical activation of CJDC, 10 %CJDC@CS-VIS-PET achieved excellent bleeding control ability. Moreover, the sandwich-structured 10 %CJDC@CS-VIS-PET showed excellent air permeability, water vapor permeability, and wound exudate management performance, which is beneficial for wound healing. The wound healing ratio on day 14 was as high as 92 %. In addition, profited from the excellent biocompatibility of chitosan, viscose and CJDC, 10 %CJDC@CS-VIS-PET exhibited outstanding blood and cell compatibility. Therefore, the sandwich-structured nonwovens loaded with the CJDC may provide a reference for developing multifunctional wound dressings with enhanced hemostatic and wound environment management properties.}
