abstract = {Combined chemo-phototherapy has shown considerable advantages and potential in cancer treatment. For this purpose, self-assembled nanoparticles by gambogic acid (GA) and IR780 (referred to as GA-IR780 NPs) were prepared. Herein, GA, an active compound derived from Garcinia hanburyi Hook.f, was selected as a chemo-agent. IR780 was used as a photothermal agent as well as a photosensitizer, which could kill tumor cells via photothermal effect and photodynamic effect. The obtained GA-IR780 NPs were uniform spheres with particle size of ca. 50 nm. The drug loading efficiency of GA and IR780 was 38.42 % and 56.64 %, respectively. The GA-IR780 NPs exhibited excellent photothermal properties as well as photodynamic effect when irradiated by near infrared (NIR) light (808 nm, 2.0 W/cm2). Moreover, the GA-IR780 NPs showed enhanced cytotoxicity with NIR light activation. Results of animal experiments showed that GA-IR780 NPs had the most significant tumor inhibition when irradiated by laser, and the results of H&E, Ki-67 and TUNEL staining confirmed that the GA-IR780 NPs+Laser group caused the most severe tumor tissue damage. The above results indicated that GA-mediated chemotherapy combining with IR780-based phototherapy could significantly improve the anti-tumor efficacy.}
