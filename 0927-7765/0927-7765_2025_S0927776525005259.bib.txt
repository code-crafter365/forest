abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment remains challenged by the systemic toxicity, non-specific targeting and high recurrence rates associated with conventional therapeutic approaches. In this study, a tumor microenvironment (TME)-activated multifunctional nanoplatform, PDTF@CM, was developed for synergistic treatment by integrating photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and chemotherapy (CT). The platform comprises a phycocyanin core with doxorubicin (DOX) and a metal-phenolic network shell, cloaked with CT26 tumor cell membrane for homologous targeting. In acidic TME of CRC, Fe³+reacts with endogenous H2S to generate photothermal agent FeS in situ, thereby activating PTT under near-infrared irradiation. Concurrently, DOX is released and enhanced Fenton reaction amplify ROS generation, enabling CDT/CT synergy. In vitro experiments showed that H₂S depletion and ROS overproduction by PDTF@CM, inducing significantly CRC cell apoptosis. In vivo experiments revealed a precise tumor accumulation, with localized hyperthermia (51°C post-irradiation) achieving significant tumor growth inhibition without systemic toxicity. The TME-responsive multi-modal platform PDTF@CM presents a novel synergistic therapy strategy for precision CRC treatment.}
