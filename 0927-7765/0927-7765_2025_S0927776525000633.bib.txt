abstract = {Unlike traditional materials designed to form large structures, many modern materials are presented in the form of powders resulting from a molecular level control of their composition and structure, making possible the miniaturization and fine-tuning of their properties to act in cellular dimensions with customized tasks. Several new materials for biomedical and microbiology applications appear every year. Although many of them are called nanomaterials, there may be a more precise description or classification. In this work, we review and detail the structural classification of nanometric, functionalized, hybrid and composite materials, mainly based on descriptions given by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Besides we included smart and multifunctional materials, cassification based on performance. The second section shows how these materials are used in the area of medical microbiology, grouping these applications into barriers for microorganisms on surfaces, disinfectants in clinical practice, targeting of pathogens, detectors of microorganisms or their metabolites, and also as substrates to stabilize, transport, or nourish beneficial microorganisms. Finally, we will discuss some evidence that indicates the environmental risk and bacterial resistance alerts that should be taken into account with the use of these advanced powder materials.}
