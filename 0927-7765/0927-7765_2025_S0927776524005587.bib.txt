abstract = {Background
The local use of drugs to promote bone healing is still difficult to apply clinically. We aimed to construct a nicorandil-based hydrogel to promote local bone healing by promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.
Results
In this study, we constructed a nicorandil-based hydrogel and used it to intervene in bone repair during bone defect reconstruction. The results showed that the nicorandil-based hydrogel significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation and promoted angiogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, bone formation was significantly promoted by the use of a nicorandil-based hydrogel. Mechanistically, Hmox1 was directly targeted by nicorandil, and overexpression of Hmox1 was found to promote bone defect reconstruction.
Conclusion
Our study provides a fresh perspective and a potential therapeutic approach for the use of local nicorandil-based hydrogels to improve bone defect reconstruction.}
