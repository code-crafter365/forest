abstract = {With the wide application of soft tissue fillers, implant material-induced inflammatory reactions have become a key factor affecting the therapeutic efficacy. This study developed an injectable filler with enhanced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by adsorbing glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine copper complex (GHK-Cu) onto hydroxyapatite microspheres (HAPs), marking the first combination of HAPs and GHK-Cu to address inflammation caused by soft tissue fillers. GHK-Cu was successfully loaded onto HAPs by electrostatic adsorption. HAPs were then mixed with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), glycerol (GLY), and water to form GHK-Cu@CMHA gel. The study focus on the effective combination of HAPs as a carrier for sustained GHK-Cu delivery and the anti-inflammatory properties of GHK-Cu. GHK-Cu@CMHA exhibits sustained release properties for 7 days, which ensures prolonged therapeutic effects, minimizes peptide waste and reduces injection frequency, with good flowability and injectability. In the model of LPS-induced inflammation model in vivo and in vitro, GHK-Cu@CMHA gel reduced levels of inflammatory factors and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels decreased, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was enhanced. In this process, H&E staining and Masson staining revealed significant collagen deposition. These findings further confirm that GHK-Cu@CMHA is a novel injectable soft tissue filler with good anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which holds well potential for inflammation inhibition.}
