abstract = {Infections caused by microorganisms on the surfaces of medical implants and devices represent a significant challenge in the field of medicine. At present, a considerable number of antimicrobial coatings have been developed with the objective of preventing bacterial contamination. However, the problem of mold contamination is often underestimated. To address this issue, a bi-molecular composite coating was developed using sulfobetaine and borneol unites, which enabled the modification of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates. Furthermore, by modifying the ratio of sulfobetaine and borneol groups, the coating can simultaneously demonstrate anti-bacterial, anti-mold adhesion and anti-biofilm properties. Notably, the bi-molecular polymer coating exhibited a synergistic effect in inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation. Subsequent in vivo subcutaneous implantation in mice confirmed its favorable biocompatibility. Therefore, this approach offers novel insights into the development of antimicrobial adhesion coatings for medical device surfaces, particularly those need to prevent biofilm formation.}
