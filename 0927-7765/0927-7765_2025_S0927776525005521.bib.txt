abstract = {In bacterial wound healing, continuous controlled oxygen delivery to injured tissue, coupled with bacterial elimination and inflammation reduction, is crucial for promoting tissue regeneration and repair. To address this, we designed a multimodal synergistic treatment strategy based on nanozymes to enable oxygen-controlled release while achieving antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. We developed a polydopamine-hyaluronic acid (PDA-HA) hydrogel composite system incorporating CuS NPs and CeO₂ nanozymes. Under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, this system exhibited enhanced photothermal performance while enabling switchable O2 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The hydrogel (termed PHCC) exhibited dual enzyme-mimic activity (peroxidase-mimic and catalase-mimic), decomposing H2O2 into either O2 or hydroxyl radicals (•OH) to regulate the infection microenvironment. Additionally, photothermal therapy (PTT) was employed to enhance the dual enzyme-mimic catalytic activity through photon-induced hyperthermia. This was achieved by utilizing the ideal light absorption of the second near-infrared window of CuS NPs and the hydrogel skeleton component PDA. Both in vivo wound healing and in vitro antibacterial experiments demonstrated that photothermally enhanced ROS-mediated treatment efficiency was significantly improved. This study provides a reference for the synergistic treatment of hyperthermia-enhanced multi-enzyme activity of nanozymes to remove bacteria and promote wound healing.}
