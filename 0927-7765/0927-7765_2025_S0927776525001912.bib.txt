Nano-selenium(SENP) plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and serves as an antioxidant in cell culture medium. This study investigated the cytoprotective effects of SENP against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced toxicity in yak Leydig cells. In this research, in vitro cultured Leydig cells were exposed to LPS to simulate Gram-negative bacterial infection. Following LPS induction, the cell apoptosis rate reached 28 %, with significant increases in inflammation and oxidative stress markers including IL-6, IL-8, MDA, and ROS. Concurrently, testosterone concentration decreased by nearly 60 %. Subsequently, SENP was introduced into the culture medium. We then evaluated apoptosis, oxidative stress, immune response, and testosterone concentration in Leydig cells. The results demonstrated that SENP effectively protected Leydig cells from LPS-induced damage.}
