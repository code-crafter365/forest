abstract = {Albendazole (ABZ), an anthelmintic drug, has been repurposed to treat various types of cancers. However, poor solubility of ABZ, resulting in low bioavailability, limits its application. Nanosuspension is a versatile method for enhancing the dissolution of hydrophobic molecules, but a successful drying has been the biggest challenge in the field. The objective of this research is to formulate and optimize ABZ nanosuspension (NS) coated granules for rapid delivery of ABZ for the treatment of colorectal cancer. ABZ NS was prepared by dual centrifugation method using Kollidon® VA64 and sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) as stabilizers. The processing method was optimized to obtain a stable nanosuspension with particle size < 300 nm. The optimized ABZ NS was coated on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) to form the nano-coated granules (NCG) and filled in EUDRACAP® for colon targeted delivery. The ABZ NS and NCG achieved ∼ 60 % and ∼55 % drug release, respectively, in presence of bile salt at colonic pH. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ABZ NS was found to be 1.18 ± 0.081 µM and 3.59 ± 0.080 µM in two colorectal cancer cell lines: HCT 116 and HT-29, respectively. In addition, In vitro 3D tumor assay revealed that ABZ NS has superior tumor growth inhibition activity compared to the control and pure ABZ. The preparation of ABZ NCG in EUDRACAP® could be a promising approach to achieve colon targeted delivery and to repurpose ABZ for the treatment of colorectal cancer.}
