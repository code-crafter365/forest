abstract = {Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a significant challenge in the treatment of myocardial infarction, a leading cause of global mortality due to irreversible cardiac damage. Biomimetic nanodelivery systems offer promising therapeutic strategies to address MIRI. In this review, we comprehensively investigate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of MIRI and discuss recent advances in biomimetic nanodelivery systems including cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, exosomes, and nanoenzymes as innovative approaches for MIRI treatment. We emphasize the advantages and potential of biomimetic strategies in enhancing therapeutic efficacy, assess the preclinical effectiveness of these nanodelivery systems, and discuss the challenges associated with translating these approaches into clinical practice. This paper aims to provide new perspectives on biomimetic strategies for MIRI treatment, contributing to the development of effective drug delivery systems.}
