abstract = {We report the synthesis of functionalized nanodots as potential powerful blockers of solute transport through a chitoporin. Ultrasmall silica nanocapsules with a diameter of ∼ 6 nm were coated with chitooligosaccharides to be used as a “lid” binding to the opening of the chitoporin VhChiP of Vibrio campbellii. Efficient blocking is attributed to the adequate size of the nanodots and their functionalization with oligochitosan, which has strong affinity towards the Vibrio chitoporin. This strategy paves the way towards the development of nanomaterials for blocking other porins.}
