abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic inflammation that gradually leads to cartilage degradation. Prolonged chondrocyte oxidative stress contributes to the development of diseases, including chondrocyte apoptosis, cartilage matrix degradation, and aggravation of articular cartilage damage. Bilirubin (BR) possesses strong antioxidant properties by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and potent protection effects against inflammation. However, its insolubility and short half-life limit its clinical use. Therefore, we developed a supramolecular system of ε-polylysine (EPL) conjugated by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the side chain, and bilirubin was loaded via host-guest interactions, which resulted in the self-assemble of this system into bilirubin-loaded polylysine-β-cyclodextrin nanoparticle (PB) with improving solubility while reducing toxicity and prolonging medication action time. To explore PB's potential pharmacological mechanisms on OA, we established in vitro and in vivo OA models. PB exerted ROS-scavenging proficiency and anti-apoptotic effects on rat chondrocytes by activating the Nrf2-HO-1/GPX4 signaling pathway. Additionally, PB reprogrammed the cartilage microenvironment by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway to maintain chondrocyte function. Animal experiments further confirmed that PB had excellent scavenging ability for ROS and inflammatory factors related to charge adsorption with cartilage as well as long retention ability. Together, this work suggests that PB has superior protective abilities with beneficial effects on OA, indicating its great potential for intervention therapy targeting chondrocytes.}
