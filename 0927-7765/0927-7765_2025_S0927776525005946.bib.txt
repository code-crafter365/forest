abstract = {This study synthesized bioactive carbon nanodots (Rb1-CDs) from ginsenoside Rb1 via hydrothermal processing. The Rb1-CDs demonstrated a uniform size distribution (5.3 ± 1.5 nm), excellent dispersibility, and excitation-dependent fluorescence. In contrast to conventional carbon dots (CDs) derived from non-bioactive precursors, the Rb1-CDs preserved the pharmacological properties of ginsenoside Rb1 while exhibiting enhanced tumor-suppressive effects. In vitro, the Rb1-CDs selectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (HGC27 and AGS) by modulating the MAPK and p53 pathways: suppression of ERK obstructed pro-proliferative signals, while activation of p38/JNK and p53 triggered G2/M cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial apoptosis via the Bax/Bcl-2-Caspase cascade. The unique nanoscale size and abundant surface functional groups of the Rb1-CDs significantly improved cellular uptake and bioavailability of ginsenoside Rb1, outperforming free Rb1. In vivo, the Rb1-CDs notably inhibited tumor growth with minimal systemic toxicity. This remarkable improvement in drug delivery characteristics, combined with the inherent bioactivity of ginsenosides, resulted in potent anti-gastric cancer effects, achieving approximately 74.0 % tumor growth inhibition in vivo with minimal systemic toxicity. These results position the Rb1-CDs as a promising nanomedicine for gastric cancer treatment.}
