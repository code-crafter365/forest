abstract = {Numerous types of contemporary antibiotic treatment regimens have become ineffective with the increasing incidence of drug tolerance. As a result, it is pertinent to seek novel and innovative solutions such as antibacterial nanomaterials (NMs) for the prohibition and treatment of hazardous microbial infections. Unlike traditional antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and tetracycline), the unique physicochemical characteristics (e.g., size dependency) of NMs endow them with bacteriostatic and bactericidal potential. However, it is yet difficult to mechanistically predict or decipher the networks of molecular interaction (e.g., between NMs and the biological systems) and the subsequent immune responses. In light of such research gap, this review outlines various mechanisms accountable for the inception of drug tolerance in bacteria. It also delineates the primary factors governing the NMs-induced molecular mechanisms against microbes, specifically drug-resistant bacteria along with the various NM-based mechanisms of antibacterial activity. The review also explores future directions and prospects for NMs in combating drug-resistant bacteria, while addressing challenges to their commercial viability within the healthcare industry.}
