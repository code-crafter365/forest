abstract = {Matrigel is the most commonly used matrix for 3D organoid cultures. Research on the biomaterial basis of Matrigel for organoid cultures is a highly challenging field. Currently, many studies focus on Matrigel-based biological macromolecules or combinations to construct natural Matrigel and synthetic hydrogel scaffolds based on collagen, peptides, polysaccharides, microbial transglutaminase, DNA supramolecules, and polymers for organoid culture. In this review, we discuss the limitations of both natural and synthetic Matrigel, and describe alternative scaffolds that have been employed for organoid cultures. The patient-derived organoids were constructed in different cancer types and limitations of animal-derived organoids based on the hydrogel or Matrigel. The constructed techniques utilizing 3D bioprinting platforms, air-liquid interface (ALI) culture, microfluidic culture, and organ-on-a-chip platform are summarized. Given the potential of organoids for a wide range of therapeutic, tissue engineering and pharmaceutical applications, it is indeed imperative to develop defined and customized hydrogels in addition to Matrigel.}
