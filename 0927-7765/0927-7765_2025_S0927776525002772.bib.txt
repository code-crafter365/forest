abstract = {Facial masks are widely used in skincare, but traditional wet masks often require preservatives to prevent microbial growth, which can cause skin irritation and environmental issues due to plastic waste from excessive packaging. To address these issues, we have developed an innovative, fast-dissolving nanofibrous facial mask that delivers curcumin (Cur), a potent antioxidant, without the need for preservatives or additives. Utilizing electrospinning technology, the polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofibrous mask not only serves as a reservoir that enhances the stability and solubility of Cur but also dissolves rapidly upon contact with minimal moisture, efficiently releasing the active compound onto the skin. The mask demonstrates strong antioxidant properties, with a DPPH radical scavenging rate of approximately 90 %, and excellent biocompatibility, as shown by its mild pH, high cell viability in fibroblast cultures, and non-irritating nature in HET-CAM assays. This novel design addresses key challenges in the facial mask industry, such as the reliance on preservatives, plastic waste, and the instability of active ingredients, while providing enhanced skincare benefits through the targeted delivery of Cur. Our approach offers a safe, eco-friendly, and effective alternative for anti-aging and protective skincare, with significant advantages over conventional wet masks.}
