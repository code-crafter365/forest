abstract = {The multifunctional composites Fe3O4/GO/NH2-MIL-53(Fe) with excellent adsorption-degradation performance was prepared for the removal of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The adsorption function of Fe3O4/GO/NH2-MIL-53(Fe) was based on the large specific surface area and abundant adsorption sites. The degradation function of Fe3O4/GO/NH2-MIL-53(Fe) was based on the activation of H2O2 by the catalytic active center formed by the coordination of metal ions and oxygen-containing groups in the system, resulting in hydroxyl radicals (·OH), superoxide anion radicals (O2-) and singlet oxygen (1O2). The adsorption of nanozyme accelerated the degradation reaction process, and the adsorption site was further exposed as the degradation process progressed. The synergistic effect realized the efficient removal of AFB1. Construction of Fe3O4/GO/NH2-MIL-53(Fe) as the carbon-doped iron-based nanozyme provided novel approaches of the removal for risks control of AFB1. Accompanied by the AFB1 adsorption, the advanced oxidation of nanozyme to the AFB1 degradation provided a promising way for the synergistic removal of AFB1.}
