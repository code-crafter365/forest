abstract = {The degenerative bone and joint disease known as osteoarthritis (OA) is typified by the wear and degeneration of cartilage, which lowers joint lubrication, intensifies the inflammatory response, and ultimately leads to an imbalance in the joint bone microenvironment, accelerating the progression of OA. In this work, a multifunctional particle (P/H-Res@Cu MOF) was created to encourage the remodeling of articular bone microenvironment by coating the surface of Cu metal-organic framework (MOF) supported by resveratrol (Res) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan quaternary ammonium salt (HACC). Because of its excellent lubricating properties, the PVA/HACC coating efficiently reduces articular cartilage wear and friction while achieving the gradual release of Res@Cu MOF. In the meantime, P/H-Res@Cu MOF considerably lowers the inflammatory state of OA by releasing Res and Cu2 + to control inflammation in response to the acidic OA microenvironment. In addition, the released Res and Cu2+ play a synergistic role by forming metal polyphenol chelates, significantly improving the antioxidant capacity. P/H-Res@Cu MOF was found to have a good anti-oxidation and inflammatory regulating activity by both in vitro and in vivo studies. By encouraging the polarization of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages, P/H-Res@Cu MOF dramatically enhances the immunological milieu in the joint cavity and, ultimately, efficiently encourages the remodeling of the articular bone microenvironment. In conclusion, the creation of P/H-Res@Cu MOF offers a fresh method of postponing the OA process.}
