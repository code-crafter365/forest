abstract = {Adequate blood supply and thorough innervation are essential to the survival of tissue-engineered bones. Though great progress has been created in the application of bone tissue engineering technology to bone defect repair, many challenges remain, such as insufficient vascularisation and deficient innervation in newly regenerated bone. In the present study, we addressed these challenges by manipulating the bone regeneration microenvironment in terms of vascularisation and innervation. We used a novel injectable thermosensitive liposome-hydrogel composite scaffold as a sustained-release carrier for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, which promotes angiogenesis and neurogenic differentiation) and dexamethasone (Dex, which promotes osteogenic differentiation). In vitro biological assessment demonstrated that the composite scaffold had sufficient cell compatibility; it enhanced the capacity for angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and the capacity for neurogenic/osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, the introduction of bFGF/Dex liposome-hydrogel composite scaffold to bone defect sites significantly improved vascularisation and innervated bone regeneration properties in a rabbit cranial defect model. Based on our findings, the regeneration of sufficiently vascularised and innervated bone tissue through a sustained-release scaffold with excellent injectability and body temperature sensitivity represents a promising tactic towards bone defect repair.}
