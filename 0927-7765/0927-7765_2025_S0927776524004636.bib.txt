abstract = {The fast biodegradation and poor biocompatibility of Mg alloys in physiological environments are still the main problems restricting their application in cardiovascular stents. In this study, the hydrogel coatings (SBMA-AAM) with different proportions of methacryloyl ethyl sulfobetaine (SBMA) and acrylamide (AAM) were built on the surface of AZ31B magnesium alloy through ultraviolet (UV) polymerization. The corrosion degradation behavior, hemocompatibility, and endothelial cell (EC) growth performance of the samples were studied in detail. The findings revealed that the uniform and dense SBMA-AAM coatings could significantly enhance the corrosion resistance. In addition, the hydrogel coatings showed excellent hydrophilicity, which increased the albumin adsorption while inhibiting the fibrinogen adsorption, and thus reduced the platelet adhesion and activation and hemolysis rate, accordingly significantly enhancing their anticoagulant performance. Furthermore, SBMA-AAM hydrogel coating promoted the EC adhesion and proliferation and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) secretion of ECs, which is conducive to promoting endothelialization. When the concentration ratio of SBMA and AAM was 1: 2, the modified magnesium alloy showed the best corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. Therefore, the SBMA-AAM hydrogel coating could effectively regulate the corrosion degradation performance and biocompatibility of Mg alloys, laying a foundation for the application of Mg alloys in cardiovascular stents.}
