abstract = {Combination therapy using inhibition of tumor cell escape and alteration of the tumor microenvironment offers a new strategy for cancer treatment. This study aimed to develop an extracellular vesicle (EV) carrier that regulates tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment to achieve efficient tumor immunotherapy. The ligand modified on carriers targets the immune checkpoint CD47 protein, blocking tumor cell escape. This ligand is cleaved by the MMP2 enzyme and assembles into nanofibers, extending the retention time in the tumor. The carriers target the CD206 protein, enabling efficient uptake by M2 macrophages. Carriers with a high density of ligands (anti-CD206) exhibit strong receptorligand interactions with tumor cells. Due to their high rigidity, these EVs have difficulty deforming during the transmembrane process, reducing resistance and resulting in low uptake efficiency by M2 cells. The optimal uptake efficiency by M2 macrophages is achieved when the mass ratio of ligand to EVs is 1:25. Crocin loaded in EVs facilitates the polarization of M2 macrophages into M1 cells, which can phagocytize tumor cells. This study reveals a potential strategy for using extracellular vesicles in tumor treatment.}
