abstract = {Background
Poor peri-implant health leads to biofilm accumulation, peri-implantitis, and bone loss. Chemical debridement may help maintain peri-implant health, but its effects on peri-implant cells remain unclear.
Methods
Five cleaning agents—hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Poloxamer, H2O2 +Poloxamer, Perisolv, and Paroex—were applied on titanium (Ti) surfaces. Mouse pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1), human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), and human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) were cultured on agent-treated Ti surfaces for up to 120 minutes to assess morphology, cytotoxicity, adhesion, and proliferation. RNA sequencing was performed on hBMSC.
Results
Except for Poloxamer, all treatments inhibited cellular spreading. Paroex increased cytotoxicity and inhibited proliferation. Perisolv impaired hBMSC adhesion and variably affected proliferation. H2O2, alone or with Poloxamer, elevated cytotoxicity and inhibited adhesion in hBMSCs but not MC3T3-E1 or HGF. In contrast, Poloxamer-treated Ti surfaces enhanced adhesion and proliferation across all cell types. RNA sequencing revealed that oxidant-based treatments (H2O2, H2O2 +Poloxamer, Perisolv) suppressed key genes for proliferation (HMGA2, JAG1, NOTCH1, YAP1, TBX3), anti-apoptosis (MCL1, BCL2L2), and adhesion (ITGA2, ITGB3, SPP1), while inhibiting MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and pluripotency pathways.
Conclusion
Commercial agents like Perisolv and Paroex impair hBMSC function, with Paroex demonstrating significant cytotoxicity. H2O2 exhibits toxicity, particularly to hBMSCs. Poloxamer improves cell attachment and growth. Given these findings, careful selection of debridement agents is critical to balance cleaning efficacy and cytocompatibility. The adverse effects on hBMSCs necessitate prompt removal postapplication. Further research on biomaterials supporting tissue regeneration postdebridement is needed to restore peri-implant health.}
