abstract = {Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation surgery is the most effective treatment for cataract. However, glistening formed by the incoming liquid microvacuoles can significantly damage postoperative visual quality after prolonged implantation, for which there is still lack of effective clinical treatment. In this study, inspired by the amazing water-repellency of natural superhydrophobic surface, a functionalized IOL material modified with the superhydrophobic and transparent coating was prepared using layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly technique combined with fluorination. After the alternate deposition of multiple cationic/anionic polyelectrolytes and silica nanoparticles of varying sizes on IOL materials, the constructed multilayered films with special surface roughness were further fluorinated to reduce surface energy. In addition to its excellent superhydrophobicity and transparency, this multilayered coating could efficiently eliminate the glistening formation of IOL under accelerated condition in vitro. Furthermore, the in vitro experiments with water droplets, cells, and bacteria suggested the superior antiadhesion property of such coating modified materials. The biocompatibility evaluation, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrated the great biocompatibility of the materials modified with superhydrophobic and transparent coating. Therefore, this multilayered coating with excellent superhydrophobic and transparent characteristics can provide an available approach aiming at anti-glistening and antiadhesion of IOL materials. Advances in the fabrication process of surface coating with specific functions will enhance the practical application and clinical success of modified IOLs.}
