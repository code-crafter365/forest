abstract = {Chitosan is widely employed in gene carriers due to its excellent gene loading capacity, ease of modification, and exceptional biodegradability. However, low gene delivery efficiency, high cytotoxicity, and lack of tracer biomimetic properties limit its clinical use. To address these issues, a novel biomimetic tracking gene delivery carrier, RBCm-C50kQT, was constructed by using the design scheme of cell membrane coated carbon quantum dots/chitosan. This carrier improves stability and tracking performance while embedding the cell membrane enhances biosafety. RBCm-C50kQT effectively carries and protects DNA, improving uptake and transfection efficiency with reduced cytotoxicity. It maintains strong fluorescence tracking and shows high uptake efficiencies of 83.62 % and 77.45 % in 293 T and HeLa cells, respectively, with maximum transfection efficiencies of 68.80 % and 45.47 %. This advancement supports gene therapy improvements and paves the way for future clinical applications.}
