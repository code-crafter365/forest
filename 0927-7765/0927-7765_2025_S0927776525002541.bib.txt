abstract = {Simple and hybrid materials represent alternatives to traditional antibiotics in the ongoing effort to combat the growing issue of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, which have emerged due to the misuse of antibiotic treatments and improper disposal of antibiotic-related waste. First, after outlining the scale of the issue, multiple potential agents that may help address the problem are presented. Inorganic metal-based and metal oxide-based nanomaterials such as silver, gold, gallium, zinc/zinc oxide, copper/copper oxide, titanium dioxide, and magnesium oxide nanoparticles are characterized, their synthesis is described, and examples of their potential antimicrobial applications are provided. Subsequent sections in a similar vein, explore nonmetallic inorganic nanoparticles and characterize organic materials that may function either as antimicrobial agents themselves (e.g., antimicrobial peptides, chitosan) or as structural components and drug carriers (e.g., cellulose, SNLs, liposomes). The final chapter offers examples of combining inorganic and organic materials into hybrid solutions for specialized antimicrobial applications and treatments, aiming to enhance their inherent antimicrobial properties or reduce the required dosage of antibiotics in therapy.}
