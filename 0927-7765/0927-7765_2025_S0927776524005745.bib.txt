abstract = {Several anions present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) not only have significant physiological functions in ECM but also play an important role in regulating peptide-based self-assembly. Herein, we have employed a non-conventional approach to overcome the limitations of the positively charged Cardin-motif peptide that failed to self-assemble at physiological pH. We used a simple and elegant strategy by employing different anions such as HPO42-, Cl- and I- to mask the overall surface charge of peptide. Interestingly, these anions were utilized to modulate the nanostructure formation and mechanical stiffness of peptide hydrogels owing to their differential interactions with water molecules according to the Hofmeister series. Interestingly, these anions induced hydrogels showed diverse cellular responses on two different cell lines, fibroblast and neuronal, indicating diverse application potential of the new scaffold. Thus, this study emphasizes the importance of anions to regulate the self-assembly of Cardin-motif peptide and this approach can be utilized in developing the ideal biomimetic model of ECM for futuristic applications.}
