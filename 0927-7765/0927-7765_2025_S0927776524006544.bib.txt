abstract = {Bacterial infections and deficient osteogenic activity are the primary factors contributing to the failure of orthopedic implants. In recent years, light- and sound-based external stimulus-responsive therapies have emerged as highly effective in killing drug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we successfully synthesized tellurium nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin (Te@BSA). This novel nanomaterial exhibits excellent biocompatibility and possesses near-infrared light (NIR) and ultrasound (US) synergistic response properties. At a concentration of 100 μg/mL, Te@BSA nanorods, under combined NIR and US treatment, achieved 94 % bacterial eradication against drug-resistant strains, while maintaining cell viability above 90 % in osteoblast cultures. This dual-modality approach minimizes the risk of local thermal damage associated with conventional photothermal therapy, enhancing osteogenic activity by up to 150 % upon NIR exposure. By combining photothermal therapy and sonodynamic therapy, we achieved a remarkable antibacterial effect and enhanced osteogenic capacities in a mild and controlled manner. This study successfully balances antibacterial and osteogenic capabilities. These light- and sound-based external stimulus-responsive strategies aslo offer new perspectives and valuable insights for the surface modification of orthopedic implants.}
