abstract = {A water stable cyclodextrin MOF (Cu-SD) was synthesized with γ-cyclodextrin derivative as organic ligand and Cu2+ as metal center to co-crystallizely load glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA). Cu-SD has a high drug loading capacity for GL (499.91 μg/mg) and GA (112.37 μg/mg), and the drug-loaded materials had a controlled release in different meadiums. In addition, Cu-SD and its drug loaded materials demonstrated better inhibiting α-glucosidase activity than the control drug acarbose. Furthermore, Cu-SD presented excellent antibacterial activity, and the antibacterial activity was significantly enhanced after GA and GL being encapsulated by Cu-SD. Moreover, both free and drug-loaded materials had good anti-inflammatory activities, and the anti-inflammatory effects of GL@Cu-SD and GA@Cu-SD were superior to those of their corresponding free drugs. Cu-SD, GL@Cu-SD and GA@Cu-SD demonstrated good biocompatibility and were applied to treat the wounds of diabetic rats. The experimental results showed that GL@Cu-SD and GA@Cu-SD had good promoting effects on the recovery of chronic diabetic wounds by suppressing wound inflammation.}
