abstract = {"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication and valuable biomarkers for various diseases. However, traditional EV isolation and detection methods often struggle with efficiency, scalability, and purity, limiting their clinical utility. Recent advances in microfluidic and paper-based technologies offer innovative solutions that enhance EV isolation and detection by reducing sample volume, accelerating processing times, and integrating multiple analytical steps into compact platforms. These technologies hold significant promise for advancing point-of-care diagnostics, enabling rapid disease detection, personalized treatment monitoring, and better patient outcomes. For example, early detection of cancer biomarkers through EVs can facilitate timely intervention, potentially improving survival rates, while rapid infectious disease diagnostics can support prompt treatment. Despite their potential, challenges such as standardization, scalability, and regulatory hurdles remain. This review discusses recent advancements in microfluidic and paper-based EV diagnostic technologies, their comparative advantages over traditional methods, and their transformative potential in clinical practice."}
