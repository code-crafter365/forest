abstract = {Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening condition. It is characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative stress, and structural disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Conventional therapies primarily provide supportive care and fail to directly intervene in the core pathological mechanisms. In recent years, nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme-mimicking catalytic activity have emerged as promising candidates for targeted ALI treatment. This review systematically summarizes the pathophysiology of ALI and the limitations of traditional therapeutic strategies. We highlight recent advances in the design and application of nanozymes with different catalytically activities for combating oxidative damage, regulating inflammatory pathways, and enhancing pulmonary repair. Multifunctional nanozyme platforms, such as those combining anti-inflammatory drugs, biomimetic coatings, and gene silencing components, are discussed for their synergistic and targeted effects. Furthermore, the critical challenges facing clinical translation including biosafety, pharmacokinetics, manufacturing scalability, and regulatory evaluation are analyzed in depth. Finally, future perspectives on mechanism-driven nanozyme design, precision medicine, and fibrosis prevention are proposed. This review provides a comprehensive framework to guide the development of safe, effective, and translatable nanozyme-based therapies for ALI.}
