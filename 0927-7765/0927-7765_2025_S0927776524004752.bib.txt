abstract = {Introduction
A local microneedle patch loaded with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was constructed to improve the efficiency of ALA photodynamic treatment of oral leukoplakia, reduce local photosensitivity reactions, and promote the healing of lesions.
Methods
The microneedle patch loaded with ALA was constructed with the hyaluronic acid (HA) solution (ALA-HAMN), and its morphology, strength, mucosal penetration, and biocompatibility were tested.
Results
In vivo safety and permeability tests confirmed that ALA-HAMN had good biocompatibility and could penetrate the mucosal barrier and quickly dissolve and release ALA for in situ transdermal administration. The 4-nitroquinoline oxide (NQO) rat model experiment showed that ALA-HAMN can significantly improve photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficiency and has no damage to mucosal tissue compared with the commonly used ALA cotton ball dressing.
Conclusions
The ALA-loaded microneedle patch was successfully constructed for the photodynamic treatment of oral leukoplakia, and the photodynamic efficiency and comfort of oral leukoplakia were improved, which provided an effective delivery mode to improve clinical ALA-PDT treatment of oral leukoplakia (OLK).}
