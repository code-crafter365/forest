abstract = {The CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, derived from the adaptive immune mechanisms of bacteria, has demonstrated remarkable advantages in fields such as gene function research and the treatment of genetic diseases due to its simplicity in design, precise targeting, and ease of use. Despite challenges such as off-target effects and cytotoxicity, effective spatiotemporal control strategies have been achieved for the CRISPR/Cas9 system through precise regulation of Cas9 protein activity as well as engineering of guide RNAs (gRNAs). This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the core components and functional mechanisms underlying the CRISPR/Cas9 system, highlights recent advancements in spatiotemporal control strategies, and discusses future directions for development.}
