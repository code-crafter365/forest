abstract = {The development of three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic scaffolds for bone and soft tissue engineering has received increasing attention due to their ability to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. This study presents the development and characterization of a 3D collagen matrix incorporating titanate nanotubes (TNT) aiming to improve cell migration and biocompatibility, with potential applications in bioink for bone and soft tissue regeneration. TNT were hydrothermally synthesized, and their properties were characterized using materials analysis techniques. After the incorporation of human fibroblasts into the collagen matrices with or without TNT, biological characterization was performed. The results showed that the incorporation of TNT significantly improved the migration efficiency and directionality compared to collagen-only matrices, which were more evident after long-term incubation. This indicates that the addition of TNT to the collagen matrixes improves the mechanical properties, promotes biocompatibility, and induces a superior environment for cell migration. These findings contribute to the development of new biomaterials for tissue engineering and demonstrate the potential of TNT as a key component of bioengineered biomaterials for bone and soft tissue regeneration.}
