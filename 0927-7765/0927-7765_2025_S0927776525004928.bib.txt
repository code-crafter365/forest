abstract = {Photothermal therapy (PTT) shows promise as an emerging treatment for psoriasis; however, its efficacy may be limited by insufficient concentrations of photothermal agents at the targeted sites. Herein, we devised a magnetic targeting enhanced strategy for alleviate psoriasiform keratinocyte proliferation by hyaluronic acid-iron oxide (Fe3O4@HA) nanocomposites. The synthesized Fe3O4@HA exhibit strong ferromagnetism and near infrared absorption, allowing it to magnetic targeting capabilities to selectively accumulate in magnetic control regions for site-specific PTT. A significant increase of up to 10 °C within the magnetic field region, highlighting exceptional both magnetic-targeted and photothermal properties of Fe3O4@HA. The murine model for psoriasis treatment further confirms the efficient accumulation of Fe3O4@HA in the diseased area by magnetic targeting, and elevated temperatures induced by site-specific near-infrared light irradiation can induce cell apoptosis, thus underscoring the potential therapeutic efficacy of Fe3O4@HA for psoriasis. This strategy offers a promising approach for the relief of psoriasis-related symptoms.}
