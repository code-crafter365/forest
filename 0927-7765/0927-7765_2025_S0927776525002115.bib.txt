abstract = {Peptide hydrogels have gained widespread attention in biomedical engineering due to their unique ability to mimic the cellular microenvironment in vivo. Stimulus-responsive self-assembled (SAP) hydrogels can undergo conformational changes in response to changes in the external environment, prompting a sol-gel transition. Their inherent biodegradability, excellent surface activity and biocompatibility make them ideal candidates for a wide range of biomedical applications, and these SAP hydrogels can be widely used in the fields of tissue engineering, cell and drug delivery, wound healing and medical diagnostic imaging. In this paper, the basic properties, design principles, preparation methods and self-assembly mechanisms of different types of stimuli-responsive SAP hydrogels are reviewed. By designing and constructing stimulus-responsive SAP hydrogels, we can create materials that mimic natural physiological environments, thereby better simulating cell behavior and tissue repair. In addition, it highlights specific applications of these hydrogels in biomedical engineering, supported by examples from recent literature. The report summarizes the current state of research, highlights key challenges, and provides insights into future prospects to encourage continued innovation and exploration in this rapidly evolving field.}
