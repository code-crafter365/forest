abstract = {The brain microenvironment (BME) is a highly dynamic system that plays a critical role in neural excitation, signal transmission, development, aging, and neurological disorders. BME consists of three key components: neural cells, extracellular spaces, and physical fields, which provide structures and physicochemical properties to synergistically and antagonistically regulate cell behaviors and functions such as nutrient transport, waste metabolism and intercellular communication. Consequently, monitoring the BME is vital to acquire a better understanding of the maintenance of neural homeostasis and the mechanisms underlying neurological diseases. In recent years, researchers have developed a range of imaging probes designed to detect changes in the microenvironment, enabling precise measurements of structural and biophysical parameters in the brain. This advancement aids in the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for brain disorders and in the exploration of cutting-edge mechanisms in neuroscience. This review summarizes and highlights recent advances in the probes for sensing and imaging BME. Also, we discuss the design principles, types, applications, challenges, and future directions of probes.}
