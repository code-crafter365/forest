abstract = {Selective detection of glucose in complex biological matrices remains a major challenge for non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors due to interference from co-existing species such as ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA). Herein, we developed an amine-functionalized Cu2O electrocatalyst (Cu2O-NH2), fabricated via a facile silanization strategy using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) on Cu2O octahedron. The introduction of surface amine group effectively suppresses the interference signals of AA and UA by 34.78 % and 46.94 %, respectively, while boosting the glucose oxidation response by 1.8-fold compared with pristine Cu2O. The resulting Cu2O-NH2 sensor showed a wide linear range of 0.00089–1.27 mM with a high sensitivity of 1.6001 mA cm−2 mM−1, and a low detection limit of 0.89 μM, along with the excellent reproducibility and long-term stability. This customized Cu2O-NH2 material ultimately exhibited accurate measurement in actual human serum. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the amine groups selectively inhibit the adsorption of AA and UA while accelerating the glucose oxidation kinetics, thus imitating the glucose oxidase-like function. Moreover, the universality of this APTES functionalization strategy was validated across other metal oxides, highlighting its potential to address the selectivity limitations of non-enzymatic sensors and offering new opportunities for the development of non-enzymatic biosensing platforms based on micro- and nano-structured materials.}
