abstract = {Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) remains an urgent issue due to its huge financial burden and high rate of disability. Here, an injectable HAP/PDA thermosensitive pluronic F-127 (PF-127) hydrogel is proposed for peripheral nerve repair. We investigated the surface characteristics of HAP/PDA and evaluated biocompatibility, cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in vitro. After injecting the hydrogel into the injured site of rats, we recorded the recovery of motor function and judged the degree of nerves through electrophysiological and morphological changes. The hydrogel was found to accelerate the nerve regeneration. Collectively, the HAP/PDA thermosensitive PF-127 hydrogel has potential in promoting sciatic nerve repair.}
