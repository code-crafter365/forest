abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds an essential role in the therapy of tumors. However, PDT consumes tissue oxygen and diminishes its own efficacy by inducing tumor hypoxia through the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway. Therefore, overcoming the photodynamic exacerbation of tumor hypoxia could reverse tumor microenvironment and enhance PDT. In this study, BC-PDA/HA loaded with bufalin (BUF) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) were developed for synergistic cancer chemo-photodynamic therapy. BC-PDA/HA, modified with hyaluronic acid (HA), exhibited CD44-targeting capability and enhanced cellular uptake in vitro. Moreover, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, BC-PDA/HA could on-demand release Ce6 and BUF, inducing PDT upon 660 nm irradiation. Simultaneously, the released BUF not only served as a chemotherapeutic agent, but also inhibited HIF-1α expression, reversing the PDT-induced tumor hypoxia. Furthermore, compared to free Ce6, BC-PDA/HA enhanced tumor accumulation and retention in vivo. BC-PDA/HA could also effectively improve hypoxia and inhibit tumor angiogenesis to enhance PDT efficacy, demonstrating synergistic chemo-PDT activity. In conclusion, this work provided a novel strategy for synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy against breast cancer.}
