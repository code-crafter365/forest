abstract = {With the increasing aging population, the demand for orthopedic implants is also growing. Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is considered a promising material for orthopedic implants due to its excellent biocompatibility. However, the lack of bioactivity and excessive immune response post-implantation often impair bone integration. Therefore, it is urgent to bio-functionalize PEEK-based implants to promote bone integration. This study employs a simple, economical, and feasible method to coat Ga-ion doped bioactive glass nanoparticles (Ga-MBGs) onto sulfonated PEEK surfaces, constructing a multifunctional PEEK-based orthopedic implant. The resulting bio-functionalized PEEK implants promote macrophage M2 phenotype polarization, thus fostering an anti-inflammatory immune microenvironment. Moreover, the direct osteogenic effect of Ga ions and the immuno-osteogenic effect through promoting macrophage M2 polarization enhance osteogenic differentiation potential in vitro and bone integration in vivo. A sequence of in vivo and in vitro experiments substantiates the essential and intricate function of this innovative orthopedic implants. in regulating normal bone immunity and metabolism. Overall, the application of Ga-MBGs provides a simple, economical, and effective method for developing multifunctional orthopedic implants. This surface bio-functionalized PEEK implant, capable of modulating immunity and bone metabolism, holds significant clinical application potential as an orthopedic implant.}
