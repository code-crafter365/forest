abstract = {This study evaluates the potential of a genetically modified, crocin-rich tomato extract (Tomafran) as a biological photoprotector and for skin health applications. Biochemical characterization and antioxidant capacity of Tomafran were assessed. Tomafran showed lower values than saffron in the ABTS assay, but similar values in the DPPH and BCBA assays. Additionally, Tomafran reduced advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human fibroblasts, which are related to the negative effects of UV radiation on the skin. The extract was encapsulated in liposomes, yielding particles with an average size of 60.96 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.06, a zeta potential of −21.50 mV, and a spherical morphology. The liposomal formulation demonstrated storage stability and a controlled release profile, with approximately 60 % of the extract released within the first 10 hours. The photoprotective capacity, measured through sun protection factor (SPF) and other biological protection factors, showed very slight improvements with increasing concentrations of Tomafran, achieving values lower than 2. The extract showed instability against UV radiation and high temperature, although encapsulation in liposomes provided protection. The anti-inflammatory properties of the liposomal Tomafran extract were evaluated using RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, showing significant reductions in proinflammatory interleukins IL-6 and IL-12. These findings highlight Tomafran's potential for mitigating inflammation associated with oxidative stress and UV-induced skin damage.}
