abstract = {Skin is a barrier that protects us against physical, chemical and biological agents. However, any damage to the skin can disrupt this barrier and therefore compromise its function leading to sometimes catastrophic consequences like sepsis. Thus, methods to detect early signs of infection are necessary. In this work, we have developed a straightforward method for producing 2D nanomembranes with regularly spaced 1D metallic nanostructures integrating sensing capabilities to pH and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which are critical analytes revealing infection. To achieve this, we have successfully fabricated a bilayered nanomembrane combining a pH-responsive polyaniline (PANI) layer and a nanoperforated poly(lactic acid) (PLA) layer containing gold nanowires (Au NWs) as NADH sensing element. SEM, FTIR, Raman and AFM techniques revealed the formation of the bilayered PANI/PLA nanomembrane and the successful incorporation of the Au NWs inside the nanoperforations. The resulting bilayered nanomembrane showed significant flexibility and conformability onto different substrates due to the softness of the polymers and the ultrathin thickness with stiffness values similar to human skin. These nanomembranes also exhibited remarkable electrochemical sensing performance towards pH and NADH detection. Thus, the nanomembrane displayed linearity with good sensitivity (47 mV pH−1) in the critical pH range 4–10 and fast response time (10 s). On the other hand, PANI/PLA-Au nanomembranes also allowed the quantitative sensing of NADH with a limit of detection of 0.39 mM and a sensitivity of 1 µA cm−2 mM−1 in the concentration range 0–5 mM.}
