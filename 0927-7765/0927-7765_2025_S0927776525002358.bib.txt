abstract = {Marine biofouling not only increases the navigation resistance of ships, accelerates the corrosion of metal substrates, but also hinders the healthy development of the marine economy. Inspired by the unique structure and function of Salvinia, we designed and fabricated biomimetic surfaces with superhydrophobic hairs and hydrophilic patches (SHHPs) using silicone rubber-graphene (SR-GN) and SR modified with polyacrylic acid (SR-PAA) composites. SHHPs can generate pinning effects underwater, forming an air layer as an environmentally friendly physical antifouling barrier. SHHPs exhibit strong capability in maintaining the air layer and can resist the attachment of bacteria and algae under static and simulated marine dynamic conditions. These results indicated that the physical antifouling strategy based on air layer provides a platform with broad application prospects for the maritime industry.}
