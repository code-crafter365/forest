abstract = {Skin cancer, encompassing melanoma and non-melanoma types, represents a significant health burden, with melanoma being particularly aggressive. Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of treatment, integrating small molecule drugs, phytoceuticals, and large biomolecules to combat this malignancy. Topical drug delivery provides a non-invasive alternative; however, the skin's inherent barriers limit drug penetration, posing a significant therapeutic challenge. Transferosomes, specialized vesicular systems, have shown potential in overcoming these limitations. Incorporated into gels, these vesicles enhance skin permeation and extend drug contact duration, reducing the frequency of applications and associated side effects. The optimization of their composition—focusing on phospholipid selection, edge activators, and manufacturing techniques—is pivotal for achieving better drug retention, enhanced penetration, and control over particle size. This review delves into the overview of skin cancer, existing treatment modalities, and their inherent constraints. It emphasizes the advantages of topical drug delivery, examining the mechanisms by which transferosomes surmount delivery challenges. Additionally, it evaluates the application of transferosomes for small-molecule drugs and phytoceuticals, underscoring their role in advancing skin cancer therapy and enhancing treatment outcomes.}
