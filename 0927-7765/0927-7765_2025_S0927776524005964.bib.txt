abstract = {Skull base defects are a common complication after transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery, and their commonly used autologous tissue repair has limited clinical outcomes. Tissue-engineered scaffolds prepared by advanced techniques of electrostatic spinning and three-dimensional (3D) printing was an effective way to solve this problem. In this study, soft tissue scaffolds consisting of centripetal nanofiber mats and 3D-printed hard tissue scaffolds consisting of porous structures were prepared, respectively. And the two layers were combined to obtain bilayer composite scaffolds. The physicochemical characterization proved that the nanofiber mat prepared by polylactide-polycaprolactone (PLCL) electrospinning had a uniform centripetal nanofiber structure, and the loaded bFGF growth factor could achieve a slow release for 14 days and exert its bioactivity to promote the proliferation of fibroblasts. The porous scaffolds prepared with polycaprolactone (PCL), and hydroxyapatite (HA) 3D printing have a 300 μm macroporous structure with good biocompatibility. In vivo experiments results demonstrated that the bilayer composite scaffold could promote soft tissue repair of the skull base membrane through the centripetal nanofiber structure and slow-release of bFGF factor. It also played the role of promoting the regeneration of the skull base bone tissue. In addition, the centripetal nanofiber structure also had a promotional effect on the regeneration of skull base bone tissue.}
