abstract = {Brain gliomas, particularly glioblastoma (GBM), are a category of brain tumors that are challenging to treat and characterized by low survival rates. Despite improvements in existing treatment options, challenges such as drug resistance, tumor heterogeneity, and the impediment of the blood-brain barrier to effective drug delivery remain prevalent. In recent years, natural polysaccharide polymers have attracted increasing interest in the treatment of GBM owing to their biocompatibility and potential for targeted delivery. Polysaccharides exert their effects through multiple mechanisms, including the modulation of the tumor microenvironment, targeted delivery, immune regulation, and participation in controlled drug release systems, potentially enhancing the adaptability of chemotherapy and extending patient survival. Additionally, this review examines colloidal parameters and biointerface interactions-such as particle size, surface charge, hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance, and membrane adsorption-that govern nanocarrier stability and BBB penetration efficiency. The development of drug delivery platforms based on natural polysaccharides can effectively address the challenges associated with drug delivery, reducing toxicity to healthy tissues. This article evaluates advancements in the use of natural polysaccharides, including hyaluronic acid, chitosan, cellulose, alginate, and starch, in the treatment of brain glioma. It underscores their significant role in eliciting anti-tumor effects and facilitating drug delivery systems, with particular emphasis on the mechanistic contributions of these polysaccharides in drug delivery processes.}
