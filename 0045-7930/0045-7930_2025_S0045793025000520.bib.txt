abstract = {This paper introduces generative Residual Networks (ResNet) as a surrogate Machine Learning (ML) tool for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) Sub Grid Scale (SGS) resolving. The study investigates the impact of incorporating Dual Scale Residual Blocks (DS-RB) within the ResNet architecture. Two LES SGS resolving models are proposed and tested for prior analysis test cases: a super-resolution model (SR-ResNet) and a SGS stress tensor inference model (SGS-ResNet). The SR-ResNet model task is to upscale LES solutions from coarse to finer grids by inferring unresolved SGS velocity fluctuations, exhibiting success in preserving high-frequency velocity fluctuation information, and aligning with higher-resolution LES solutions’ energy spectrum. Furthermore, employing DS-RB enhances prediction accuracy and precision of high-frequency velocity fields compared to Single Scale Residual Blocks (SS-RB), evident in both spatial and spectral domains. The SR-ResNet model is tested and trained on filtered/downsampled 2-D LES planar jet injection problems at two Reynolds numbers, two jet configurations, and two upscale ratios. In the case of SGS stress tensor inference, both SS-RB and DS-RB exhibit higher prediction accuracy compared to other explicit closure models such as the Smagorinsky model or the Approximate Deconvolution Model (ADM) with reference to the true DNS SGS stress tensor, with DS-RB-based SGS-ResNet showing stronger statistical alignment with DNS data. The SGS-ResNet model is tested on a filtered/downsampled 2-D DNS isotropic homogeneous decay turbulence problem. The adoption of DS-RB incurs notable increases in network size, training time, and forward inference time, with the network size expanding by over tenfold, and training and forward inference times increasing by approximately 0.5 and 3 times, respectively.}
