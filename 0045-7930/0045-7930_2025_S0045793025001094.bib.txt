abstract = {The current surge in interest surrounding small unmanned aerial vehicles can be attributed to their extensive range of applications. This growing interest is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in knowledge regarding their aeroacoustic performance and behavior. Studies concentrate on commercial geometries, with low-fidelity models being employed as they are deemed sufficient for the acquisition of the requisite quantities for flight mechanics. This paper aims at providing a detailed description of a drone propeller aeroacoustic performance using a high level of modeling. This propeller is computed with a Large Eddy Simulation turbulence model and with two distinct mesh resolutions. The aeroacoustic performance of the propeller is evaluated for both configurations and compared to quantify the losses due to the reduction in mesh resolution, with the aim of limiting the computational cost. It is observed that the grid resolution does not affect the computation of the integral force. Furthermore, the overall flow topology remains qualitatively similar, despite some localized quantitative differences. Notably, the size of the separated region varies, and discrepancies in the computed acoustic waves and energy levels are observed between the simulations.}
