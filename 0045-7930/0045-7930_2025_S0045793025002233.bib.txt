abstract = {A three-dimensional SPH computational framework is presented for modeling fluid–structure interactions with structural deformation and failure. We combine weakly compressible SPH with a pseudo-spring-based SPH solver to capture the fluid flow and deformable structures. A unified modeling approach captures the solid boundaries and fluid–structure interfaces without penalty-based contact force. The δ-SPH technique improves the pressure calculations in the fluid phase, while structural damage is modeled using a pseudo-spring approach, with particle interactions limited to its neighbors. The present framework can capture the three-dimensional crack surfaces in structures without any computationally intensive crack-tracking algorithm or visibility criteria. The framework has been proven effective against existing models and experimental data, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness in simulating detailed fracture patterns and offering insights into the impact of hydrodynamic events on structural integrity.}
