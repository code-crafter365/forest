abstract = {The present work provides a time-resolved benchmark dataset for simulating supercritical, unsteady flow inside a square lid-driven cavity (LDC). To explain the role of fidelity of the computations and that of the numerical error in triggering instabilities, the flow is computed with three time-steps. This effort is substantiated with the use of an error dynamics equation, developed to model the physical processes in the Navier–Stokes equation (NSE), using global spectral analysis (GSA) of a model convection–diffusion equation. The error is found to be diffusion-dominated for this particular class of flows. There exists lack of consensus regarding the critical value of Reynolds number (Re) beyond which flow becomes unsteady for the square LDC. The study aims to bridge this gap by devoting a detailed discussion on the onset of unsteadiness by simulating LDC for Re in the range of 7900 to 8900. Furthermore, the first Hopf bifurcation that is typically observed for LDC is quantified, laying the foundation for development of data-driven machine learning alternatives to expensive high fidelity simulations.}
