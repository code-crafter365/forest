abstract = {In this study, we propose an improved immersed boundary method with dual-layer local triangulation. A novel code was developed for high-order numerical simulations of supersonic flows over multiple complex irregular geometries. A fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme was implemented to capture any steep gradients in the flow created by the geometries. The simulations were carried out on Cartesian grids and the Delaunay triangulation method was implemented twice near the boundary to refine the object boundary discretization and improve the numerical simulation robustness for complex irregular geometries. The proposed method could successfully evaluate various two- and three-dimensional compressible flows with immersed boundaries. Moreover, we studied the flow mechanism over irregularly shaped debris generated by multiple disintegrations during spacecraft re-entry in near-space, with a particular focus on spherical debris objects. We also propose a self-affine fractal interpolation surface method for spherical surfaces to effectively characterize the near-space debris. The improved immersed boundary method with the dual-layer local triangulation was used to simulate the supersonic flow over multiple side-by-side fractal spherical objects. Numerical examples conclusively verified the effectiveness, generality, and robustness of the proposed method.}
