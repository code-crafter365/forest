abstract = {In this paper, we present a kinetic model with flexible velocities that satisfy positivity preservation conditions for the Euler equations. Our 1D kinetic model consists of two velocities and employs both the asymmetrical and symmetrical models. Switching between the two models is governed by our formulation of kinetic relative entropy, together with an additional criterion that ensures a robust and accurate scheme yielding entropic results. In 2D, we introduce a novel three-velocity kinetic model, defined to ensure a locally one-dimensional formulation for the resulting macroscopic normal flux. For first order accuracy, we also obtain a limit on the time step that ensures positivity preservation. The resulting numerical scheme captures grid-aligned steady shocks exactly. Several benchmark compressible flow test cases are solved in 1D and 2D to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver.}
