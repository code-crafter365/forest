abstract = {Brazing and soldering are metallurgical joining techniques that use a wetting molten metal to create a joint between two faying surfaces. The quality of the brazing process depends strongly on the wetting properties of the molten filler metal, namely the surface tension and contact angle, and the resulting joint can be susceptible to various defects, such as run-out and underfill, if the material properties or joining conditions are not suitable. In this work, we implement a finite element simulation to predict the formation of such defects in braze processes. This model incorporates both fluid–structure interaction through an arbitrary Eulerian–Lagrangian technique and free surface wetting through conformal decomposition finite element modeling. Upon validating our numerical simulations against experimental run-out studies on a silver-Kovar system, we then use the model to predict run-out and underfill in systems with variable surface tension, contact angles, and applied pressure. Finally, we consider variable joint/surface geometries and show how different geometrical configurations can help to mitigate run-out. This work aims to understand how brazing defects arise and validate a coupled wetting and fluid–structure interaction simulation that can be used for other industrial problems.}
