abstract = {We introduce a high-order space–time approximation of the Shallow Water Equations with sources that is invariant-domain preserving (IDP), well-balanced with respect to rest states, and employs a novel explicit Runge–Kutta (ERK) introduced in Ern and Guermond (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 44(5), A3366–A3392, 2022) for systems of non-linear conservation equations. The resulting method is then numerically illustrated through verification and validation.}
