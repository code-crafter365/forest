abstract = {High-order methods such as discontinuous Galerkin (DG), spectral, and flux reconstruction (FR) achieve high accuracy in smooth regions but suffer from spurious oscillations near shocks. Standard monotonicity-preserving limiters suppress these oscillations but often reduce accuracy near smooth extrema to first order. We propose a novel limiter that effectively handles shocks while preserving high-order accuracy. The key idea is to expand the standard monotonicity limits (or bounds)—without enlarging the stencil—to provide “room” near smooth extrema, ensuring that limiting has no effect and thus preserving accuracy. Near discontinuities, thanks to the use of the median function, these expanded limits effectively reduce to the original limits, suppressing oscillations. The limiter's accuracy- and range-preserving properties are established through propositions and proofs. Our approach is partially guided by a key insight into DG solutions for advection at a discontinuity: the mode of degree k grows at a rate proportional to 2k+1. This growth rate arises from formulating the DG method within the FR framework using Radau polynomials, where a recurrence relation for their derivatives plays a central role. The FR framework also enables the derivation of monotone high-order solutions. For simplicity, our limiter uses a bound related to the linear monotone solution. Motivated by the modal growth behavior, the bound is extended to higher orders by applying it to the sum of all modal magnitudes, implemented in increasing mode order. In contrast, standard limiters employ different bounds for different modes and are typically implemented in decreasing mode order. Unlike conventional methods that rely on smoothness detection—which may fail and compromise continuous data dependence—our limiter preserves continuous dependence and can be applied globally. For efficiency, we introduce criteria to skip limiting in smooth regions where it has no effect. The resulting algorithm is simple to implement and is validated through numerical tests on the advection and Euler equations.}
