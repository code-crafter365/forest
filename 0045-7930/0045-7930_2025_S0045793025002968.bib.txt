abstract = {Strong turbulence interacting with a free-surface is a challenging problem, where the interface between gas and liquid is disrupted, generating droplets and bubbles. Turbulent bubble entrainment and breakdown is of paramount importance to quantify mass and momentum transport, and developing lower order models. Thus far, computational costs of scale resolving simulations (for both interface and turbulence) have limited the ability to study these flows. In this work we leverage recent advances in two-phase solvers, including a splitting scheme for the Poisson equation allowing the use of FFT-based Fast Poisson Solvers (FPS) greatly reducing solution time, with verifiable accuracy; coupled with the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) for a sharp interface treatment. The proposed formulation uses the level set approach, with a dual-redistancing scheme for global mass conservation of each phase. To analyze strong free-surface turbulence, homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) is forced under an air–water interface to analyze stationary statistics of the flow including entrained bubble sizes and Reynolds stresses. Two different approaches are used for the sub-surface forcing. The first uses the common linear forcing scheme in physical space, which imposes a constraint on the domain size. The alternative approach relies on the synthetic random Fourier method to generate a boundary condition which reduces the total computational domain, allowing for higher Reynolds number simulations of turbulent free-surface flows.}
