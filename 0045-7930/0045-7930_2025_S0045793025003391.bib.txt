abstract = {Aortic dissection is a serious clinical condition characterized by a tear in the intima of the aortic wall. To better understand and treat this complex condition, researchers increasingly use hemodynamic simulations based on fluid-structure interaction (FSI). However, time-dependent three-dimensional FSI simulations in aortic dissection are complex and often inefficient in terms of computational time and memory. In this paper, we present a highly scalable parallel numerical method to simulate the blood flow in a full-sized aorta with dissection. The blood flow is modeled using the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, and the aortic wall is modeled as linear elastic material in a Lagrangian description. The entire system is discretized monolithically by a stabilized finite element method in space and a fully implicit scheme in time, and the resulting algebraic system is then solved using the Newton-Krylov-Schwarz method. Hemodynamic parameters within the aortic dissection are examined, revealing differences from simulations that rely solely on computational fluid dynamics. Scalability tests on a supercomputer demonstrate a parallel efficiency of 44.1 % with up to 2304 processor cores, reducing the simulation time for an entire cardiac cycle to 0.36 h.}
