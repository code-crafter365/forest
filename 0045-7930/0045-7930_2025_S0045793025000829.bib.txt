abstract = {We show that finite element discretizations of incompressible flow problems can be designed to ensure preservation/dissipation of kinetic energy not only globally but also locally. In the context of equal-order (piecewise-linear) interpolations, we prove the validity of a semi-discrete energy inequality for a quadrature-based approximation to the nonlinear convective term, which we combine with the Becker–Hansbo pressure stabilization. An analogy with entropy-stable algebraic flux correction schemes for the compressible Euler equations and the shallow water equations yields a weak ‘bounded variation’ estimate from which we deduce the semi-discrete Lax–Wendroff consistency and convergence towards dissipative weak solutions. The results of our numerical experiments for standard test problems confirm that the method under investigation is non-oscillatory and exhibits optimal convergence behavior.}
