abstract = {The present work aims to investigate the effects of the electromagnetic field on detonation propagation in a tube. The reactive Euler equations are developed with the addition of Lorentz force as the source terms and are solved with the combination of hybrid Roe/HLL scheme and the Adaptive Mesh Refinement technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the detonation wave can be decelerated by applying Lorentz forces in the direction opposite to its propagation. By varying the force magnitude, the wave is slowed down by approximately 40 %, 80 %, and even completely (100 %). The detonation cellular structures disappear also with the applied forces. The wave shape is almost the same shape as the applied Lorentz force. Furthermore, the strong shock waves induced by the force directly ignite the hot spots and make the detonation self-sustained.}
