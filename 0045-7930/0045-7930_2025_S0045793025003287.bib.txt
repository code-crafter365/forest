abstract = {Mixed convection is ubiquitous in nature and industrial processes that involve the combination of both natural and forced convective flows. It plays an important role in broad range of engineering applications such as in cooling of electronics, heat exchangers, HVAC systems, etc. Optimizing the thermal management systems is crucial for achieving effective cooling or heating in industrial equipments. By comprehending and utilizing the phenomenon of mixed convection, one can effectively design thermal systems that attain superior overall performance. Here, we present detailed investigations on the influence of four rotating circular cylinders on mixed convection within a square cavity. We investigate the effects of various parameters such as Richardson number (Ri), Reynolds number (Re) and location and direction of rotation of cylinders. These factors are shown to influence the heat transfer rates significantly, which is shown via streamlines and isotherms pattern within the cavity for varying values of Re and Ri. A radial basis function based meshless method is developed for the simulation of mixed convection scenarios. High-order accuracy is demonstrated by first simulating the benchmark case of cylindrical Couette flow. We have also provided detailed validation and verification for thermal convection problems by comparing our findings to experimental and numerical results in the published literature.}
