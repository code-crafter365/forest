abstract = {Numerical simulations of detonation-containing flows have emerged as crucial tools for designing next-generation power and propulsion devices. As these tools mature, it is important for the combustion community to properly understand and isolate grid resolution effects when simulating detonations. To this end, the objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the numerical convergence of unsteady detonation simulations, with focus on isolating the impacts of chemical timescale modifications on convergence characteristics in the context of operator splitting. With the aid of an AMReX-based adaptive mesh refinement flow solver (Sharma et al., 2024)—which enables resolutions up to O(1000) cells-per-induction length—the convergence analysis is conducted using two kinetics configurations: (1) the simplified three-step Arrhenius-based model mechanism of Short and Quirk (1997), where chemical timescales in the detonation are modified by adjusting activation energies in the initiation and branching reactions, and (2) a detailed hydrogen-air mechanism (Mével et al. (2009), Shepherd (2018)), where the chemical timescales are adjusted by varying the ambient pressure. The convergence of unsteady self-sustained detonations in one-dimensional channels is then analyzed with reference to steady-state theoretical baseline solutions using these mechanisms. The goal of the analysis is to provide a detailed comparison of the effects of grid resolution on both macroscopic (peak pressures and wave speeds) and microscopic (wave structure) quantities of interest, drawing connections between the deviations from steady-state baselines and minimum chemical timescales. In particular, chemical timescale reductions were found to have minimal impact on the convergence of macroscopic properties. However, analyses of microscopic convergence trends, particularly in the reaction front location, revealed a key insight: maintaining the induction time while eliminating prohibitive chemical timescales through mechanism simplifications and combustion modeling can significantly enhance detonation convergence properties. Ultimately, this work uncovers resolution-dependent unsteady detonation convergence regimes and highlights the important role played by not only the chemical timescales, but also the ratio between the chemical timescale and induction time on the numerical convergence of the detonation wave structure.}
