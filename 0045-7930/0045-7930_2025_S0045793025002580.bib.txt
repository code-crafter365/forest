abstract = {Additive Manufacturing allows for exploring various geometries to achieve specific engineering criteria. Lattices are one geometry with unique properties, including being periodically repeating structures which allow flow through them to be represented as a porous media according to Darcy-Forchheimer equations. These equation’s coefficients are generally experimentally derived, but this work demonstrates the ability to numerically derive them with CFD. Simulations were performed using three-dimensional stead state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes with a k-ω Shear Stress Transport turbulence model using Ansys Fluent. Three lattice geometries were investigated and resistance coefficients were derived. The method was validated against externally published data for similar geometries demonstrating strong agreement, and grid convergence for all simulations was calculated with a Grid Convergence Index method. Wall roughness is demonstrated to have a non-negligible impact on results and roughness values are considered for the primary focus Octahedral geometry where both smooth wall and rough wall coefficients were derived. The porosity coefficients for the Octahedral geometry were found to be 2.89×106 and 2.90×106 [1/m2] for the permeability coefficients, 6.37×101 and 5.44×101 [1/m] for the inertial resistance coefficients, and with a max pressure drop of 5116.7 [Pa] and 4429.5 [Pa] for the smooth walls and rough walls at 1.0 [m/s], respectively. The derived numerical method enables rapid exploration and optimization of new lattice designs for diverse engineering applications.}
