abstract = {This study presents an automatic multi-objective optimization framework based on a continuous adjoint method to optimize fans and blowers. The framework is built by connecting open-source tools, such as Salome (CAD and mesh generators) and OpenFOAM v2206 (CFD solver and optimizer) using several Python scripts. The sensitivity is calculated using a fully turbulent continuous adjoint solver, adjointOptimisationFoam, in OpenFOAM v2206. Two new objective functions, including aeraulic and mechanical powers, are integrated into the adjoint solver. Then, a forward-curved centrifugal blower (FCCB) is optimized to confirm the generated framework’s capability. The aim is to maximize aeraulic power while minimizing the mechanical power of the FCCB, resulting in a total efficiency improvement. Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations closed with the k-ω SST model are used to simulate the turbulent flow in the centrifugal blower. After four optimization cycles, mechanical power decreased by 0.71% and aeraulic power increased by 0.73%, resulting in a 1.5% improvement in total efficiency.}
