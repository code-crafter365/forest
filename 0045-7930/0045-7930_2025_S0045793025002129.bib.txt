abstract = {Seeking simple and effective flow control methods for high angle-of-attack airfoil separated flows has always been a pursued goal. A new flow control method called “stepped flap” is designed and investigated. The stepped flap works by designing a portion of the upper surface of the airfoil as a movable airfoil that deflects around the front end and stays attached to the airfoil at the rear end, thus creating a step region that is used to control the separation vortex at the trailing edge of the airfoil. The flow control mechanism of the stepped flap at is studied, and the influence of the deflection angle and length of the stepped flap on the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil is investigated. The results show that the stepped flap can effectively prevent the development of leading-edge vortex (LEV) and accelerate the shedding of the trailing-edge vortex (TEV). Compared with the original airfoil, the application of the stepped flap can effectively delay the stall and improve the lift and lift-to-drag ratio characteristics of the airfoil. Additionally, at specific angles of attack, there is an optimal deflection angle for the stepped flap that achieves the best aerodynamic performance of the airfoil. Furthermore, when the length is within 0.4c-0.6c, the longer the stepped flap is, the better the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil is. The stepped flap features a simple structure while possessing strong flow control capabilities, it can provide a feasible new way to control airfoil flow in aircraft, wind turbine and other fields.}
