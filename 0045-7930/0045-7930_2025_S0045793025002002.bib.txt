abstract = {Meshfree methods require a pre-processed particle distribution that is suitable for the body to obtain high-precision solutions. Currently, there remains a deficiency in point distribution approaches that can simultaneously satisfy the isotropic point distribution requirements of body-fitted uniform distributions while also addressing the computational speed, scale, and robustness demands of point distribution calculations. In this paper, we propose a novel system for generating body-fitted and isotropic point cloud for meshfree methods applied to complex geometries using High-Performance Computing (HPC). Modular design is applied to this system. Firstly, this system employs an external wall particle distribution module designed to facilitate uniform point distribution of wall particles along with boundary condition marking for various surfaces. Subsequently, an internal fluid particle filling module is utilized for large-scale internal fluid particle filling at variable filling spacings with enhanced robustness. Finally, the body-fitted adjustment of the internal fluid particle module is implemented using an improved Discrete Element Method (DEM) proposed in this paper to refine the internal fluid particle arrangement and ensure compliance with isotropic body-fitting distributions. During computations, this system employs CUDA and MPI technologies to enable accelerated computing. Numerical experiments have conclusively shown that our system is adept at generating a robust and rational isotropic point distribution for complex geometries. This capability satisfies the pre-processing demand for meshfree methods, ensuring both rapid computation speed and enhanced robustness for large-scale point cloud generation.}
