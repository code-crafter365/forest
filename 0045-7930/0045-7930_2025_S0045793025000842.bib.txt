abstract = {This work extends the fully coupled single-zone CVFEM-based flow solver developed by Mangani et al. (2022) into multi-zone configurations. This extension necessitates proper treatment of the interfaces between domains, which may be non-conformal. The suggested approach utilizes an implicit Discontinuous Galerkin method along these interfaces, accommodating both direct connections between domain pairs as well as translational and rotational periodic connections. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by solving the following five benchmark test problems: (i) flow past a NACA 0012 airfoil, (ii) blood flow in the carotid artery, (iii) flow in a short intake with a converging section, (iv) flow in a low pressure turbine blade cascade, and (v) flow in a hydraulic turbomachine. Results obtained, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the developed approach and validate its predictions.}
