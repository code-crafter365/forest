abstract = {This paper presents a divergence cleaning formulation for the velocity in the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme. The proposed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning, ensures that the velocity divergence, div(u), is minimised throughout the simulation. The divergence equation is coupled with the momentum conservation equation through a scalar field ψ. A parabolic term is added to the time-evolving divergence equation, resulting in a hyperbolic/parabolic form, dissipating acoustic waves with a speed of sound proportional to the local Mach number in order to maximise dissipation of the velocity divergence, preventing unwanted diffusion of the pressure field. The div(u)-SPH algorithm is implemented in the open-source weakly compressible SPH solver DualSPHysics. The new formulation is validated against a range of challenging 2-D test cases including the Taylor-Green vortices, patch impact test, jet impinging on a surface, and wave impact in a sloshing tank. The results show that the new formulation reduces the divergence in the velocity field by at least one order of magnitude which prevents spurious numerical noise and the formation of unphysical voids. The temporal evolution of the impact pressures shows that the div(u)-SPH formulation virtually eliminates unwanted acoustic pressure oscillations. Investigation of particle resolution confirms that the new div(u)-SPH formulation does not reduce the spatial convergence rate.}
