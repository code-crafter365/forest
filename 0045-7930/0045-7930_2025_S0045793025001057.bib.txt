abstract = {This short note introduces a novel diagnostic tool for evaluating the convection boundedness properties of numerical schemes across discontinuities. The proposed method is based on the convection boundedness criterion and the normalised variable diagram. By utilising this tool, we can determine the CFL conditions for numerical schemes to satisfy the convection boundedness criterion, identify the locations of over- and under-shoots, optimise the free parameters in the schemes, and develop strategies to prevent numerical oscillations across the discontinuity. We apply the diagnostic tool to assess representative discontinuity-capturing schemes, including THINC, fifth-order WENO, and fifth-order TENO, and validate the conclusions drawn through numerical tests. We further demonstrate the application of the proposed method by formulating a new THINC scheme with less stringent CFL conditions.}
