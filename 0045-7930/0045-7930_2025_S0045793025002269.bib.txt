abstract = {A novel solver for chemically reacting flows, named lusgsReactingFoam, has been developed within the open-source framework OpenFOAM. This solver employs an implicit finite volume lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) method to solve the fully coupled Navier-Stokes and species transport equations efficiently. It is particularly well-suited for high-speed reacting flows, as encountered in shock tubes, vehicle re-entry, detonation, supersonic combustion, and supersonic steam cracking. Moreover, the solver is even capable of handling reacting flows in subsonic compressible and incompressible regimes, making it a highly versatile tool capable of managing large variations in velocity and temperature within the same fluid domain. The solver's performance is validated through several test cases relevant to steam cracking, ranging from conventional bare reactors to transonic and supersonic flows, including shock tubes. The results demonstrate that the new solver overcomes challenges where standard OpenFOAM reactive solvers fall short. lusgsReactingFoam demonstrates greater versatility compared to the reactive solvers within the ANSYS Fluent suite, which are optimized for either subsonic/transonic flows (coupled pressure-based solver) or supersonic flows (density-based solver). Its strong agreement with one-dimensional simulations and experimental data further highlights its reliability and efficiency in modeling chemically reacting flows. lusgsReactingFoam marks a major breakthrough in the development of open-source computational tools within OpenFOAM. It enables the simulation of subsonic, transonic, and supersonic reactive flows for applications targeted to the development and design of turbomachinery and propulsion systems, supersonic hydrogen combustion, pressure gain combustion and supersonic steam cracking processes.}
