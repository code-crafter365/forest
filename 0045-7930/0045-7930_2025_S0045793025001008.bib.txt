abstract = {A framework for numerical evaluation of entropy-conservative volume fluxes in gas flows with internal energies is developed, for use with high-order discretization methods. The novelty of the approach lies in the ability to use arbitrary expressions for the internal degrees of freedom of the constituent gas species. The developed approach is implemented in an open-source discontinuous Galerkin code for solving hyperbolic equations. Numerical simulations are carried out for several model 2-D flows and the results are compared to those obtained with the finite volume-based solver DLR TAU.}
