abstract = {Microfluidic trapping arrays have proven to be efficient tools for various applications that require working at the single-cell level, such as cell–cell communication or fusion. Although several hydrodynamic trapping devices have already been optimised, two-dimensional (2D) single-layer trapping arrays with high trap densities remain partially inefficient. Specifically, many traps remain empty, even after prolonged injection, which drastically reduces the number of samples available for post-treatment. These unfilled traps result from the symmetrical nature of the flow around the traps, and breaking this symmetry enhances capture efficiency. In this study, we use a numerical approach to show that optimal geometries can significantly increase filling efficiency and a preliminary experimental test confirming our approach is provided. We show that these improvements are achieved by promoting lateral dispersion of particles, facilitated either through an optimised oblique flow or by introducing disorder into the spatial arrangement of traps without specific inlet/outlet adjustment.}
