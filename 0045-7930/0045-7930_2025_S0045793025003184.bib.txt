abstract = {The paper proposes a physically consistent numerical discretization approach for simulating viscous compressible multicomponent flows. It has two main contributions. First, a contact discontinuity (and material interface) detector is developed. In those regions of contact discontinuities, the THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) approach is used for reconstructing appropriate variables (phasic densities). For other flow regions, the variables are reconstructed using the Monotonicity-preserving (MP) scheme (or Weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme (WENO)). For reconstruction in the characteristic space, the THINC approach is used only for the contact (or entropy) wave and volume fractions. For the reconstruction of primitive variables, the THINC approach is used for phasic densities and volume fractions only, offering an effective solution for reducing dissipation errors near contact discontinuities. The numerical results of the benchmark tests show that the proposed method captured the material interface sharply compared to existing methods. The second contribution is the development of an algorithm that uses a central reconstruction scheme for the tangential velocities, as they are continuous across material interfaces in viscous flows. In this regard, the Ducros sensor (a shock detector that cannot detect material interfaces) is employed to compute the tangential velocities using a central scheme across material interfaces. Using the central scheme does not produce any oscillations at the material interface. The proposed approach is thoroughly validated with several benchmark test cases for compressible multicomponent flows, highlighting its advantages. The physics appropriate approach also shown to prevent spurious vortices, despite being formally second-order accurate for nonlinear problems, on a coarser mesh than a genuinely high-order accurate method.}
