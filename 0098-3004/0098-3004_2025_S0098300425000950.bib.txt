abstract = {Geodiversity has gained increasing attention, prompting geoscientists to advocate for its recognition to promote holistic nature conservation. UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGps) have expanded globally, promoting geoheritage and contributing to geoconservation and sustainable tourism. In this framework, the IGCP 714 project, "3GEO – Geoclimbing & Geotrekking in Geoparks," launched in 2021, aims to use Geographical Information Technologies (GIT) – including GIS, remote sensing, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and other geospatial tools - to enhance geoscience communication within UGGps. However, there is still a significant need for a repeatable, accessible, low-cost, and effective workflow to integrate these digital technologies into geoscience communication effectively. This study developed a workflow for creating Digital Outcrop Models (DOMs) of geosites and geodiversity sites used for recreational climbing and trekking. Using technologies such as UAVs and Smartphones equipped with LiDAR sensors, the workflow generates DOMs that can be integrated into web-GIS applications and Virtual Reality experiences, offering interactive educational content. Four examples are described, illustrating the implementation of the DOM workflow from the outcrop scale (La Pedriza Granitic Batholith, Spain, and Etna Volcano Lava Tube, Italy) to the terrane scale (Organ Pipes Columnar Jointing, Australia, and Baceno Tectonic Window, Italy). The workflow is designed to produce DOMs for public and student engagement, demonstrating their potential for broader educational and geoconservation applications. Moreover, the workflow aims to build capacity among Geopark practitioners and researchers by improving techniques for creating content on geoheritage features and enhancing geoscience communication. For this, the workflow is designed to be repeatable by employing common and relatively low-cost GIT tools. We discuss the need for investment in capability, software, and hardware to equip Geopark practitioners with the skills required to implement this workflow. By applying this workflow to create DOMs of geoheritage features, we demonstrate its potential to enhance the appreciation of geodiversity, support education and research, and promote sustainable geotourism within UGGps.}
