abstract = {Understanding deformation networks, visible as curvilinear lineaments in images, is crucial for geoscientific explorations. However, traditional manual extraction of lineaments is expertise-dependent, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. This study introduces an automated method to extract and identify geological faults from aeromagnetic images, integrating Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization (BHO), Principal Component Wavelet Analysis (PCWA), and Hysteresis Thresholding Algorithm (HTA). The continuous wavelet transform (CWT), employed across various scales and orientations, enhances feature extraction quality, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) within the CWT eliminates redundant information, focusing on relevant features. Using a Gaussian Process surrogate model, BHO autonomously fine-tunes hyperparameters for optimal curvilinear pattern recognition, resulting in a highly accurate and computationally efficient solution for curvilinear lineament mapping. Empirical validation using aeromagnetic images from a prominent fault zone in the James Bay region of Quebec, Canada, demonstrates significant accuracy improvements, with 23% improvement in Fβ Score over the unoptimized PCWA-HTA and a marked 300% improvement over traditional HTA methods, underscoring the added value of fusing BHO with PCWA in the curvilinear lineament extraction process. The iterative nature of BHO progressively refines hyperparameters, enhancing geological feature detection. Early BHO iterations broadly explore the hyperparameter space, identifying low-frequency curvilinear features representing deep lineaments. As BHO advances, hyperparameter fine-tuning increases sensitivity to high-frequency features indicative of shallow lineaments. This progressive refinement ensures that later iterations better detect detailed structures, demonstrating BHO's robustness in distinguishing various curvilinear features and improving the accuracy of curvilinear lineament extraction. For future work, we aim to expand the method's applicability by incorporating multiple geophysical image types, enhancing adaptability across diverse geological contexts.}
