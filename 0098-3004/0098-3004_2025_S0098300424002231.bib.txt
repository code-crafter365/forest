abstract = {In the face of escalating global energy demands, this study introduces an Adaptive Constraint-Guided Surrogate Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithm (ACG-EBS) for optimizing horizontal well placements in oil reservoirs. Addressing the complex challenge of maximizing oil production, the ACG-EBS integrates geological, engineering, and economic considerations into a novel optimization framework. This algorithm stands out for its adept navigation through a complex and discrete decision space of horizontal well placements, an area where traditional methods often encounter challenges. Key innovations include the Adaptive Constraint Initialization Mechanism (ACIM) and the Evolutionary Constraint-Tailored Candidate Refinement strategy (ECTCR), which collectively elevate the feasibility of candidate solutions. An enhanced balance strategy harmonizes comprehensive and niche surrogate models, optimizing the balance between exploration and exploitation. Through testing on both two-dimensional and three-dimensional reservoir models, the ACG-EBS has proven highly effective in identifying optimal well placements that align with field deployment realities and maximize economic returns. This contribution significantly supports the ongoing evolution of oilfield development optimization, showcasing the algorithm's potential to enhance oil production and economic outcomes.}
