abstract = {An application based on graphical processing units (GPUs) applied to 3-D digital images is described for computing the linear anisotropic elastic properties of heterogeneous materials. The application can also retrieve the property contribution tensors of individual inclusions of any shape. The code can be executed on professional GPUs as well as on a basic laptop or personal computer Nvidia GPUs. The application is extremely fast: a calculation of the effective elastic properties of volumes consisting of about 7 million voxel elements (1913) takes less than 4 s of computational time using a single A100 GPU; 3 min for 100 million voxel elements (4793) using a single A100 GPU; 14 min for 350 million voxel elements (7033) using a single A100 GPU. Several comparisons against analytical solutions are provided. In addition, an evaluation of the anisotropic effective elastic properties of a 3-D digital image of a cracked Carrara marble sample is presented. The software can be downloaded from a permanent repository Zenodo, the link with a doi is given in the manuscript.}
