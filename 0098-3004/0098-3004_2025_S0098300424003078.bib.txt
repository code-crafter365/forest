abstract = {Although most CO2 geologic storage projects focus on deep saline aquifers, depleted gas reservoirs are a more economical option as a potential site. However, due to the extremely low initial pressure, the injection of high-pressure supercritical CO2 into the reservoir can result in dramatic changes in CO2 properties, which may affect the well head pressure and bottom hole pressure. Aside from the injection rate, the injection of supercritical CO2 at different temperature and pressure has varying degrees of impact on reservoir pressure. In order to design the optimal injection condition, a deep learning proxy model, combining wellbore-reservoir coupling numerous simulations, is proposed to quickly interrogate status response of wellbores and reservoirs. Based on 567 simulation cases of supercritical CO2 injection into a deep depleted gas reservoir, the model uses the T2Well/ECO2N software to capture the time evolution of the pressure, temperature, and rate fields of wellbore and reservoirs, and is trained to get the optimal LSTM-based proxy network. Compared with simulation results, the proxy model predicts in less than 0.1s while ensuring an overall coefficient of determination (R2) of up to 99.9%. The maximum prediction errors of pressure, temperature, and rates at all times are also not more than 0.04, 0.02, and 0.08 for a single case, respectively. The assessment findings of the ultimate reservoir pressure based on the model show that injecting supercritical CO2 under low initial pressure and high temperature is beneficial to the long-term safety of CO2 sequestration engineering in depleted gas reservoirs.}
