abstract = {Compared to traditional gravity observations, the disturbing gravity gradient captures more high-frequency information from the Earth's gravity field. Due to the difficulty in directly obtaining gravity gradient measurements, we can calculate the gravity gradient by the Stokes integral methodology. However, this computational process faces two main issues: 1) Obtaining an analytical expression from the integral of the original function is difficult, necessitating the use of numerical integration methods; and 2) Large volumes of data can lead to reduced computational speed. In our study, Chebyshev wavelet numerical integration is employed to improve the integration accuracy in calculating the disturbing gravity gradient. We also provide the derivation process for nodes and weights based on the Chebyshev wavelet integral. Concurrently, the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) enables parallel computing on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to improve computational speed. We detail the application of these techniques and translate theoretical concepts into a practical computational program. Experiments conducted on marine area data illustrate that integrating Chebyshev wavelet numerical integration with CUDA parallel computing not only ensures precise calculations but also significantly boosts computational efficiency.}
