abstract = {The risk of dynamic disasters increases with the trend toward deeper mining, highlighting an urgent need to better understand induced seismicity. To address this need, we developed custom code to implement the open-source software PyLith in the study of induced seismicity for the first time. We examined the effects of heterogeneous geological conditions on dynamic ruptures induced by deep mining operations. Our focus was on the dynamic ruptures and their effects on the nearby working face, analyzing parameters such as peak slip rates and rupture velocities. Our results show that rupture duration ranges from 255 ms to 676 ms and peak slip rates vary between 1.3 m/s and 5.0 m/s, with rupture velocities decreasing from 1.29 km/s to 0.17 km/s as the critical slip distance (Dc) increases. The relationship between peak slip rate and rupture velocity is consistent with Bizzarri's (2012) findings. A linear relationship between the times of peak slip rate (Tpv) and breakdown time (Tb) was observed, with a ratio of 1.0. In examining the induced seismic waves at the working face, we found that heterogeneous models exhibited more irregular slip distributions and higher peak particle acceleration (PPA) and peak particle velocity (PPV) compared to homogeneous models, indicating amplified seismic responses due to material heterogeneity. The study also identified potential risks to the working face's structural integrity, with more pronounced effects observed in hanging wall mining compared to footwall mining. These findings underscore the importance of considering geological heterogeneity in seismic hazard assessments and support the development of more accurate predictive models for mining-induced seismic events. It is important to note that our comparison of heterogeneous and homogeneous modeling is based on the assumption of identical initial traction, focusing on the effects of heterogeneous layers.}
