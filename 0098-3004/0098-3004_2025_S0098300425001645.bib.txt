abstract = {We introduce a novel focused gravity inversion algorithm and develop corresponding software, highlighting three key innovations. First, we propose the Adaptive Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Regularization algorithm, which efficiently and adaptively determines the regularization parameter. Second, we incorporate the Sigmoid Function to stabilize the inversion process, significantly accelerating iterative convergence. Third, we have developed a user-friendly software with a graphical user interface for this new method, utilizing the popular high-level and interactive programming language MATLAB. To promote knowledge sharing and resource accessibility, we have made the software open-source. To validate our approach, we tested the algorithm on both synthetic and real gravity data, demonstrating its exceptional capability to accurately reconstruct the 3D density distribution of complex subsurface structures. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis between the new algorithm, the conjugate gradient method constrained by SF, and the standard conjugate gradient method. The results indicate that the new method requires fewer iterations and exhibits higher computational efficiency.}
