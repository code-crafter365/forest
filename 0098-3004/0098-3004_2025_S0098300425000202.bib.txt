abstract = {Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is crucial for enhancing subsurface imaging, yet its applications often confronts computational and usability challenges. This paper introduces GPR-FWI-Py, a comprehensive 2D GPR FWI code package that addresses these challenges through a multi-scale strategy, a random excitation source strategy, and Total Variation (TV) regularization. Optimized for high-performance computing, the software is developed in pure Python, ensuring both high efficiency and accessibility. Key features include user-friendly design and readability, which empower users to easily adapt and maintain the software to meet specific project needs. Performance evaluations on layered and Over-Thrust models confirm that our strategies significantly improve FWI results. The modular architecture of GPR-FWI-Py not only simplifies the integration of the FWI algorithm into GPR imaging but also enhances adaptability by supporting the introduction of additional functionalities.}
