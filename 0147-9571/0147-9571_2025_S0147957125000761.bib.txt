abstract = {Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) is a zoonotic pathogen, causing a systemic wasting disease in avian as well as lung infections in humans. To evaluate the risks of psittacosis posed through pet birds, 182 fecal samples were collected from commercially popular parrot species, including budgerigars (n = 87), cockatiels (n = 28), and lovebirds (n = 67), in Xining City, northwestern China. Through molecular methods, results revealed that an overall C. psittaci prevalence of 14.3 % (26/182), while species-specific infection rates of 21.8 % (19/87) in budgerigars, 10.7 % (3/28) in cockatiels, and 6.0 % (4/67) in lovebirds. Phylogenetic analysis ompA, 16S rRNA, and 16–23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS) gene sequence obtained in this study confirmed that all sequences were classified to the Chlamydiaceae family and showed a high similarity to C. psittaci strains 6BC, that was previously identified in avian. This is the first documented report of C. psittaci prevalence in the pet bird markets on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These findings provided an essential baseline data for understanding the epidemiology of C. psittaci in northwestern China and highlighted the need for surveillance to mitigate potential zoonotic risks.}
