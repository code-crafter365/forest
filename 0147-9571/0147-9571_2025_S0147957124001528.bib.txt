abstract = {Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a prevalent vector-borne disease in the Mediterranean region, notably Algeria. This research aims to assess the epidemiology and the clinical management practices of CanL employed by veterinarians in the Skikda and Constantine regions in the northeastern part of Algeria. A retrospective survey comprising 37 open and closed questions was distributed to 139 veterinary clinics between 2022 and 2023. The objective was to collect comparable epidemiological information on clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, treatment protocols, preventive strategies, and awareness of the disease's public health implications. The findings from this study have revealed a notable prevalence of CanL in both regions, accompanied by similar clinical manifestations. Serological techniques, particularly rapid detection kits, are predominantly utilized alongside direct methods, while euthanasia remains the primary approach to combat the disease. The results show that only a few veterinarians educate pet owners about zoonotic diseases and prevention measures (32,79 %), while most do not provide this information. This investigation sheds more light on the current status of CanL in the selected studied area and suggests the need for standardizing diagnosis and treatment of CanL using evidence-based medicine criteria to enhance disease management. This will provide a proper way of conducting a more comprehensive epidemiological assessment of the condition for improving the handling and management of CanL in Algeria.}
