abstract = {Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spirochetes, poses a significant global public health threat. Rodents, particularly those inhabiting urban environments, are recognized as the primary reservoirs for human infections. Therefore, conducting epidemiological studies on pathogenic Leptospira in urban rodent populations is essential for evaluating the risk of human leptospirosis. In this study, we captured 263 Rattus norvegicus from urban residential areas across five districts in Guangzhou to access the prevalence and genetic diversity of pathogenic Leptospira. Our findings revealed the presence of two pathogenic Leptospira species, L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii, which are the primary pathogens responsible for human leptospirosis in China, in four of the five districts, with an overall prevalence of 10.3 %. Given the close proximity of R. norvegicus to human populations in urban areas, this significant prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira indicates an elevated risk of leptospirosis outbreaks among residents of Guangzhou. These results highlight the urgent need for ongoing monitoring of pathogenic Leptospira infections in urban rodent populations to prevent and control potential outbreaks of leptospirosis in the city.}
