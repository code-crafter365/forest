abstract = {Domestic cats are companion animals that live with people in their households or outdoors, and strong relationships exist between cats and humans. However, this animal is also a host/reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, including Rickettsia species. In Türkiye, cat ownership has increased over the years, but there is a lack of data on the pathogens in cats. In this study, 396 cat blood samples were collected from different parts of Türkiye, and these samples were investigated for Rickettsia species with PCR assay. In addition, DNA sequences were performed for species identification and phylogenetic analyses of detected Rickettsia species. 24 out of 396 cat blood samples (6.06 %) were found to be infected with Rickettsia species. The DNA sequence analyses of all PCR-positive samples were done, and Ri. aeschlimannii was identified in 17 samples, Ri. slovaca in four, Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae in two, and Ri. raoultii in one sample. The phylogenetic analyses of obtained DNA from the above-mentioned species were performed. The sequence data belonging to the species were uploaded to the GenBank, and accession numbers for Rickettsia aeschlimannii (PP998242-PP998258), Ri. slovaca (PP998259-PP998262), Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae (PP998263-PP998264), and Ri. raoultii (PP998265) were taken. This result provides the first molecular detection of Ri. aeschlimannii, Ri. slovaca, Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae, and Ri. raoultii in Türkiye. Moreover, the DNA of Ri. aeschlimannii, Ri. slovaca, and Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae were identified in cat blood samples for the first time in the world, and the cats were a new host for these Rickettsia species. Detailed studies are, however, needed to determine the pathogenicity, biological characteristics, and vectors of these Rickettsia species in this new host.}
