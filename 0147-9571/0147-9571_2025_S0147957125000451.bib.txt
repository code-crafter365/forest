abstract = {Pathologies caused by parasitic infections, including protozoans and helminths remain a burden for healthcare in many countries. The DNA damage is produced by numerous parasites, both protozoans and helminths. However, the exact number of cancer-causing parasites and their role in neoplasma formation is still undetermined. The progression and dynamics of parasitic infections are significantly influenced by endogenously induced increase in oxidative stress (OS). Increased ROS production undermines antioxidant defense mechanisms by disrupting the balance between prooxidants and antioxidants, causing structural damage to important biomolecules, including host DNA. The generation of DNA damage possibly leads to the progression of carcinogenesis. However, direct DNA damage by parasites, eggs and factors released by parasites is also possible, and it leads to genomic instability that is a hallmark of most human and animal cancers. Understanding the way parasites induce DNA damage in the hosts may be helpful in the control of parasitic infections and the prevention of parasite-induced malignancies, ultimately benefiting the health of humans and animals. This review article offers an updated overview of parasitic infection-induced DNA damage mechanisms.}
