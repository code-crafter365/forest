abstract = {Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), caused by Leishmania spp., is an important vector-borne and largely zoonotic disease in Algeria. The country ranks as the primary focus of leishmaniasis in the African subcontinent and the second-largest focus globally. Three distinct epidemiological types of CL have been described: anthroponotic CL (ACL), zoonotic CL (ZCL), and sporadic CL (SCL). The incidence of leishmaniasis fluctuates annually, highlighting the need for more efficient diagnostic tools, improved treatment options, and effective preventive measures. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary and discussion of studies on CL conducted in Algeria, with a particular focus on control strategies, the key challenges associated with their implementation, and the impact of environmental and climatic factors on the disease's spread. Published articles on leishmaniasis in Algeria were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar and ResearchGate databases. Inclusion criteria for the articles were based on keyword searches including “Cutaneous leishmaniasis in Algeria”, “Extension of leishmaniasis in Algeria”, and “Leishmaniasis epidemiology in Algeria” which are publicly accessible as of 31th December 2024. CL is a major and widespread parasitic infection in Algeria, with 299725 cases reported between 1982 and 2023. There is compelling evidence indicating that both zoonotic and anthroponotic forms of leishmaniasis are expanding their geographic range in the country, largely driven by factors such as climate and environmental changes. Infections have been reported in all provinces, including endemic regions in Algeria's arid and semi-arid areas. However, control strategies for leishmaniasis remain limited, poorly implemented in many parts of the country, and face numerous challenges.}
