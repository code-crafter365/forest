abstract = {The public health concern about H5N1 avian influenza persists because of its lethal nature and its capability to spread between different species and its growing resistance to conventional antiviral medications. The antiviral drug potential of sialidases from Clostridium perfringens remains under investigation because these enzymes can strip sialic acid from viral surfaces which prevents viral attachment to host cells. This study aimed to determine the antiviral effects of C. perfringens sialidase on H5N1-infected BALB/c mice through both preventive and curative treatment protocols. The mice received intranasal sialidase at two concentrations of 187.5 mU/ml and 375 mU/ml for three consecutive days either before viral exposure or after viral challenge. The study included weight tracking and ELISA tests to measure lung tissue viral antigens as well as lung tissue histopathology and IL-6 and TNF-α expression analysis. The treatment with 375 mU/ml sialidase twice proved most effective in maintaining physiological function and reducing viral load and lung tissue damage. The treatment results demonstrated that it reduced inflammatory response by lowering IL-6 and TNF-α expression levels. The research proves that C. perfringens sialidase exhibits antiviral and immunomodulatory actions when used in vivo. The curative outcome depends heavily on treatment dose and frequency which will impact future implementation. The antiviral properties of C. perfringens sialidase make it a promising therapeutic option for treating influenza virus strains that are resistant to drugs.}
