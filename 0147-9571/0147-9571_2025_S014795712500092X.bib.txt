abstract = {Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, is a zoonotic disease with significant global public health implications. In Algeria, data on its epidemiology are scarce. This study aimed to assess for the first time the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and identify associated risk factors among pregnant women in Biskra governorate in southeastern of Algeria. A cross-sectional survey (October 2022–May 2023) involved 453 women. Data on socio-demographics characteristics, gynecological history, and lifestyle habits were collected via structured questionnaires. Plasma samples were analysed for IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISA techniques. Statistical analyses, including univariate and multivariate logistic regression, were performed to identify significant risk factors associated with seropositivity. The overall seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis was 30.02 %. Univariate analysis identified several significant associated risk factors, including a history of spontaneous abortion (OR = 3.897), having single spontaneous abortions (OR = 4.96), consumption of unpasteurized milk (OR = 1.789), and owning pets (OR = 1.593). Living in urban areas appeared to be a protective factor (OR = 0.60). Multivariate analysis further highlighted feeding raw meat to animals (AOR = 8.395) and having given birth to a malformed child (AOR = 6.718) as major risk factors. Additionally, fast food consumption (AOR = 2.07) and cats ownership (AOR = 3.724) were also significantly associated with T. gondii seropositivity. The findings underscore the importance of implementig robust screening, prevention, and treatment strategies for toxoplasmosis, particularly among pregnant women. This study offers valuable epidemiological insights into toxoplasmosis in Algeria, addressing a critical knowledge gap.}
