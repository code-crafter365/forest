abstract = {This study, investigates the prevalence of Eimeria species in broiler farms in Medea, Algeria. A total of 200 samples were collected from 26 breeding farms across 07 regions in Medea, finding a prevalence rate of 100 %. Five Eimeria species were present in all broiler farms. The results indicated that most fecal samples contained multiple Eimeria species. The decreasing infection rates of Eimeria in the studied broiler farms were: E. Mitis (92,5 %), E. tenella (81 %), E. necatrix (76 %),E. maxima (38,5 %), E. brunetti (22 %),E. acervulina (00 %), and E. praecox (00 %). This indicates that E. mitis is the predominant species in the province of Medea.Histopathological examination of the intestines revealed destruction of epithelial cells caused by the development of the parasite's asexual stages, leading to errosive and hemorrhagic lesions throughout the entire intestine. The mucosa appeared denuded and disrupted, with intense inflammation extending from the lamina propria to the submucosa. Additionally, thickening of the muscularis mucosa was observed, along with broken or fused tips of the villi. These results indicated that the prevalence of coccidiosis is high among the broiler farms in Medea province, North of Algeria. As a conclusion, it seems that the epidemiological situation of poultry coccidiosis in Medea province must be taken into consideration in order to minimize the economic losses caused by this parasitosis.}
