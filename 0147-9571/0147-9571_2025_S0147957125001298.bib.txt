abstract = {The Columbidae are widely distributed in Algeria and play important ecological and cultural roles. However, they are also recognized as hosts of diverse ectoparasite communities that may affect bird health and act as potential reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. Despite this importance, knowledge about the diversity, distribution of ectoparasites associated with columbids in Algeria remains fragmentary. This study aimed to provide a complete inventory of ectoparasites infesting domestic and wild columbids in northern Algeria, specifically to (i) assess the species richness of ectoparasites across hosts (ii) identify potential host-specific infestation patterns and (iii) report new records that extend the known geographic distribution of ectoparasitic taxa. Fieldwork was conducted between 2020 and 2023 in three regions of northern Algeria (Blida, Algiers, Tipaza). A total of 133 individuals from six columbid species were examined using standardized capture, handling, and parasite collection protocols. Ectoparasites identified through morphological keys under stereomicroscopy, supplemented by taxonomic descriptions from the literature. A total of 11,294 ectoparasites were recovered, belonging to 16 species across different groups: 13 lice (Phthiraptera), one mite (Acarina), one tick (Ixodida), and one fly (Diptera). Notably, three lice (Colpocephalum turbinatum, Bonomeilla columbae, and Coloceras hilli) were recorded for the first time in Algeria, while Columbicola joudiae was documented for only the second time worldwide and the first time in the country. Lice were the most abundant and showed clear host specificity across columbid species. The mite Falculifer sp., the tick Argas reflexus, and the fly Pseudolychia canariensis were less frequent but indicate a broad spectrum of ectoparasitic taxa infesting columbids. This study offers the first comprehensive overview of columbid ectoparasites in Algeria, revealing high diversity and new records. It emphasizes their ecological and veterinary significance, and calls for further molecular and ecological studies on host–parasite interactions and pathogen transmission.}
