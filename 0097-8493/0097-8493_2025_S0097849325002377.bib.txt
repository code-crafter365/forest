abstract = {Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) is a powerful tool in clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring for detecting various types of molecules. Building on this foundation, Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging (LSPRi) offers spatially-resolved sensing and has emerged as an active area of research with growing interest within the scientific community. However, analyzing LSPRi data remains complex, requiring users to configure models, choose analysis parameters, and interpret derived metrics—often across disconnected tools or custom scripts. We present a visualization framework that supports users throughout the full analysis process. It automates certain aspects of the analysis while still allowing users to configure models and parameters and visualizes both intermediate and final results to facilitate comparison and interpretation. Our system was developed in close collaboration with domain experts through an iterative design process and evaluated through interviews with scientists using LSPRi in their research. It has the potential to streamline LSPRi data analysis, enabling researchers to explore, compare, and refine their modeling choices more efficiently.}
