abstract = {The great success of diffusion models in the text-to-image field has driven the increasing demand for fine-grained local image editing. One of which is changing the viewpoint of objects to given positions in accordance with 3D geometric principles. How to keep the surrounding region unchanged and maintain structural and semantic consistency when editing the designated objects is a challenging yet widely applicable task. However, existing methods often fail to maintain correct geometric structure and editing efficiency simultaneously. To this end, we explore the geometric structure changes of images when the viewpoint changes from the perspective of 3D camera projection and propose a geometry-aware local viewpoint editing approach that requires neither 3D reconstruction nor model training, and performs editing solely at a single timestep in the latent space of diffusion models. Central to our approach is constructing latent-space location mappings across different viewpoints by integrating multi-view geometry theory with the absolute depth information. To address assignment conflicts and latent feature missing problems while enhancing detail fidelity, we design an occlusion reasoning mechanism and a foreground-background aware bilateral interpolation strategy. Additionally, a consistency-preserving strategy is introduced to enhance alignment with the original image. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate the overall advantages of our approach in structural consistency and runtime efficiency.}
