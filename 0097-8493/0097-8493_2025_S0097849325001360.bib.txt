abstract = {Due to its ability to create novel views and bypass conventional rendering, visualization generation has become a trending topic of deep learning for scientific visualization research. Given a set of direct volume rendering (DVR) images for training, existing solutions design neural networks to learn the mapping between input parameters and output images. Once learned, the network can synthesize novel views from unseen parameters. However, no attempt is made to reconstruct the underlying volumes for more flexible downstream visualization synthesis. In this paper, we introduce neural reconstruction of volumes for visualization enhancement (ReVolVE), a new framework based on the neural radiance field that reconstructs high-quality density and color volumes from unlit DVR images to enable novel view synthesis with various visualization enhancement options. Leveraging a compact volume representation with an efficient vector–matrix decomposition scheme and a color-based volume segmentation, ReVolVE can effectively separate density and color volumes that cover prominent visual content implicitly represented by a generic transfer function mapping, paving the way for subsequent visualization enhancement via neural rendering or conventional rendering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReVolVE across multiple volumetric datasets, showcasing its visual enhancement outcomes and comparing its superior performance against representative state-of-the-art methods (DiffDVR, Plenoxels, 3DGS, TensoRF, and Instant-NGP).}
