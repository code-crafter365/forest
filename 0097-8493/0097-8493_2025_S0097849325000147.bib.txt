abstract = {The layout of commercial space is crucial for enhancing user experience and creating business value. However, designing the layout of a mid-scale commercial space remains challenging due to the need to balance rationality, functionality, and safety. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes the Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) to generate commercial space layouts automatically. Our method is a multi-level spatial division framework, where at each level, we create and optimize Voronoi diagrams to accommodate complex multi-scale boundaries. We achieve spatial division at different levels by combining the standard Voronoi diagrams with the rectangular Voronoi diagrams. Our method also leverages Voronoi diagrams’ generation controllability and division diversity, offering customized control and diversity generation that previous methods struggled to provide. Extensive experiments and comparisons show that our method offers an automated and efficient solution for generating high-quality commercial space layouts.}
