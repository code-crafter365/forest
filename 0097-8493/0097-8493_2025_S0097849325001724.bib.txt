abstract = {Traditional Chinese painting (TCP) presents unique challenges for text-to-image models, including composition logic deficiency, lack of inscription semantics, and style deviations. This study proposes the “InkSpirit” framework, employing an expert knowledge-driven approach to address these issues by: (1) constructing a TCP dataset with composition-based Blank Space Principles, (2) building an Artistic conception-Inscription corpus, and (3) designing a generation framework based on ComfyUI workflow for precise control over TCP elements. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in image quality metrics, with validation through expert and user evaluations, advancing the integration of traditional art with AI technology.}
