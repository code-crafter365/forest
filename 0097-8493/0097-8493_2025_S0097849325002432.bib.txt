abstract = {Head-mounted display (HMD) Virtual Reality (VR) has seen significant developments in recent years. The tech is finally being adopted by millions of consumers worldwide. System control through menu interfaces is crucial in VR for task completion. Unlike traditional two-dimensional (2D) devices, HMD-VR allows six degrees of freedom (DoF) interaction and navigation in three-dimensional (3D) and 360°virtual environments (VEs). This makes designing and placing user interface (UI) elements in VEs challenging because there is no apparent surface or boundary in VE to place UI elements like menus. Over the recent years, VR app stores have seen the introduction of numerous VR applications. However, there is a notable lack of guidance for designers and developers on designing and integrating crucial UI components, such as menus, for HMD-VR applications. This paper presents a systematic literature review of HMD-VR menu UIs. A total of 33 studies from Scopus and Web of Science databases published in English between 2012–2024 were identified using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results describe (a) key factors that are considered when designing and evaluating menus for HMD-VR, (b) state-of-the-art on types of menu UI based on integration, and (c) study-specific design guidelines proposed on menus for HMD-VR. Furthermore, we propose synthesized, context-aware recommendations to inform future menu UI development. By bridging research insights with practical design implications, this review aims to support the creation of more usable, immersive, and goal-oriented VR interfaces.}
