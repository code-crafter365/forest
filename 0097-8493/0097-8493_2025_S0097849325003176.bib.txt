abstract = {Human-machine Interface (HMI) serves as the core medium within the vehicle. Its trend towards large-screen and multi-screen design is a significant manifestation of today’s intelligent cabins. However, this trend also brings risks of distracting drivers' attention and affecting driving safety. Therefore, this study used virtual reality (VR) technology to provide a simulated driving environment for participants, and explored the impact of HMI-related attributes in the intelligent cabin, namely "central control screen size," "central control screen orientation," "secondary screen size," "types of central control screen information recognition tasks," on drivers’ cognitive load through simulated driving experiments. Additionally, we investigated the impact of "driving experience" on drivers' cognitive load. According to the results, during the simulated driving process, "types of central control screen information recognition tasks" had a significant effect on drivers' cognitive load. Compared to the text format, presenting information in a grid format on the central control screen resulted in a lower cognitive load for drivers. When performing text tasks, four variables—"central control screen size," "central control screen orientation," "secondary screen size," and "driving experience"—significantly influenced drivers' cognitive load. In contrast, during grid tasks, only two variables—"central control screen orientation" and "secondary screen size"—had a significant impact on drivers' cognitive load.}
