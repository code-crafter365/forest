abstract = {In this article, we report on research exploring tangible interfaces for authoring cutaway visualizations in Mixed Reality (MR). The proposed approach is to allow users to create the outline of a virtual cutaway section by physically tracing their fingers directly on the surface of a real object, to reveal virtual information within. Building on a prototype of such system, developed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2, we conducted user studies to compare the performance and feedback of participants using a tangible system in contrast to the completion of analogous tasks using conventional mid-air gestures. The experiments revealed that the tangible interface supported more accurate tracing, and participants consistently rated it as more intuitive and effective. These findings highlight the promise of tangible approaches and provide compelling direction for future work.}
