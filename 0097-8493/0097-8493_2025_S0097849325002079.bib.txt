abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that total generalized variation (TGV) effectively preserves image features while avoiding staircase artifacts common in total variation (TV) regularization. This paper proposes a novel hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising method that extends conventional 2D TGV to 3D TGV in the spatial–spectral domain through a tensor-formulated framework, where first-order term characterizes spatial–spectral gradients and second-order term encodes both spatial/spectral curvature and cross-band curvature. Specifically, the proposed approach synergistically combines this 3D TGV regularization, maintaining an adaptive balance between detail preservation and smooth transition restoration, with Tucker decomposition that captures global spectral low-rankness. To solve the resulting optimization problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Extensive results and comparisons on simulated and real HSIs with mixed noise demonstrate that our method achieves superior denoising performance, yielding significant improvements in both visual quality and quantitative metrics (e.g., MPSNR, MSSIM, ERGAS) compared to existing approaches.}
