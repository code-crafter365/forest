abstract = {Using speech for hands-free interaction in Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining popularity, supported by advances in natural language processing that enable accurate speech-to-text transcription and intent inference. Prior work has shown that voice-based navigation is effective when hand use is restricted or occupied, particularly when visually salient points in the scene, known as landmarks, can be identified and articulated. However, in many virtual environments, such landmarks may be absent or not easily recognizable, limiting the applicability of voice commands. To address this, we propose three landmark-free, user-centered coordinate systems to support speech-based locomotion in VR: Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical. Each system uses a distinct encoding and interaction style. The Cartesian system employs a simple three-digit code and requires low cognitive effort. The spherical system prioritizes precision but demands higher mental effort. The cylindrical system combines elements of both, offering a balance between usability and accuracy. We evaluated these systems in a quantitative user study with 24 participants, all with backgrounds in information technology. The study assessed the systems’ effectiveness for object positioning and navigation, comparing them to teleportation, the standard non-voice locomotion method in VR. Results show that the Cartesian system enables faster and more intuitive navigation compared to the spherical system. Distinct usage patterns were observed, with users predominantly focusing on the central field of view during navigation. Our findings indicate that user-centered coordinate systems are practical to implement and present a viable alternative for speech-driven, hands-free navigation in VR.}
