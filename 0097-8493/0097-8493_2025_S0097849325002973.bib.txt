abstract = {Real-time cloud modeling is crucial in computer graphics, atmospheric science, and virtual reality applications. Current methods for cloud modeling often inadequately represent realistic density variations and detailed cloud edges. To this end, we present a real-time modeling framework using multi-layer noise and coordinate-driven dynamics for realistic, detailed cloud modeling. The proposed framework utilizes 3D Perlin–Worley noise to construct volumetric cloud structures and incorporates density control to achieve layered visual effects. In addition, it employs a noise-driven flow map to refine edge details and enhances dynamic features such as cloud movement and deformation. To validate our approach, we conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments to compare our method with others and with real observational meteorological data, as well as a user study on perceptual quality. Results indicate that our method achieves better real-time performance and realism, particularly in edge details, which are essential for visual fidelity and interactive applications.}
