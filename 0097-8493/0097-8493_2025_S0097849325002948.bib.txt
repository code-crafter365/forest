abstract = {Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis and surgical planning, but accurately merging segmented 3D models with volumetric medical data remains a significant challenge. Traditional surface-based 3D models provide a clear structural representation but may introduce segmentation inaccuracies, whereas Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) maintains all image details but lacks explicit surface definition. We present a novel hybrid rendering algorithm that seamlessly integrates Per-Pixel Linked Lists for accurate transparency sorting of 3D meshes with DVR techniques to ensure a smooth and precise blending of both data types. This approach captures the advantages of both methods—preserving the structural clarity of surface models while maintaining the depth and density information from the medical image. Our algorithm operates in real time and is compatible with virtual reality, enhancing spatial perception through stereoscopic visualisation. By allowing direct interaction with both segmented models and volumetric data, this technique reduces reliance on radiologists’ reports and improves surgical planning. Performance evaluations confirm real-time rendering, and an expert-based usability study further supports the method’s relevance for advanced medical visualisation applications.}
