abstract = {The development of machine learning (ML) applications in deep drawing is hindered by limited data availability and the absence of open-access benchmarks for validating novel approaches, including domain generalization over distinct geometries. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive U-shaped dataset tailored to this manufacturing process. Our U-Channel sheet metal (UCSM) dataset combines 90 real-world meshes with an infinite number of synthetic geometry samples generated from four parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, ensuring extensive geometry variety and data quantity. Additionally, a ready-to-use dataset for drawability assessment and segmentation is provided. Leveraging CAD and mesh data sources bridges the gap between sparse data availability and ML requirements. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed parametric models are geometrically valid, and real-world and synthetic data complement each other effectively, providing robust support for ML model development. While the dataset is confined to U-shaped, thin-walled, deep drawing scenarios, it considerably aids in overcoming data scarcity. Thereby, it facilitates the validation and comparison of new geometry-generalizing ML methodologies in this domain. By providing this benchmark dataset, we enhance the comparability and validation of emerging methods for ML advancements in sheet metal forming.}
