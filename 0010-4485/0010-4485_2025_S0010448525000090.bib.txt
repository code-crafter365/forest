abstract = {We present a method for the interactive design of B-spline surfaces that accommodate cutting tool paths for high-precision flank milling, referred to as flank-millable surfaces. This approach explores the integration of surface design with manufacturing, aligning it with the principle of Design for Manufacturability (DFM). To enhance modeling flexibility, the design surface, cutting tool shape, and tool motion paths are all treated as variables within an optimization framework. The design surface is composed of a sequence of machined strips, with smooth transitions between adjacent strips to ensure high surface quality. To improve computational efficiency and support an interactive design process, we reformulate the constraints as quadratic equations and employ the guided projection method for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in designing complex freeform surfaces, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.}
