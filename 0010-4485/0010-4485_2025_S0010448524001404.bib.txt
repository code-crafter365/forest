abstract = {For the highly interacting machining features, Layered Projection Decomposition Method presents inferior recognition efficiency and accuracy, due to its high-cost 3D projection and failures in determining projection faces for internal occluded faces. To address these issues, we propose a potential hybrid recognition framework. We first introduce a straightforward adjacent projection wire (APW) over UV wires, automatically restoring the full projection wires from highly interacting features. Building on APWs, an efficient hybrid boundary representation and its corresponding unambiguous primitive definitions are proposed by combining with graph-based boundary representations. Subsequently, we design an efficient primitive decomposition method by introducing primitive boundary matching to decide the initial projection faces, and introducing iterative projection boundary expansion to complete the full primitives from occluded faces. Moreover, we establish an efficient Graph Neural Network to learn the distinguishable distributions over the decomposed primitives. Specifically, an Adjacency Attention Unit is proposed to automatically perceive the influence weight of adjacent nodes, leading to more discriminative self-adaptive shape embedding for efficient primitive recognition. Finally, we summarize convenient reconstruction rules to correct the wrong predictions of feature faces with indistinguishable adjacent relationships. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed recognition framework, CAD models of complex aircraft structural parts are collected to present a challenging machining feature dataset. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed hybrid recognition framework enables significant improvements over the state-of-the-art machining feature recognition techniques.}
