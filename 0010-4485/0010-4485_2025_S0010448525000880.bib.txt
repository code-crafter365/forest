abstract = {Spectral geometry is a mathematical field that links geometrical properties to eigenvalues of differential operators on surfaces. Although it is a well-established tool in geometry processing and has been used in many contexts, the structural engineering and architectural geometry communities have not yet adopted this framework for shape modeling. This paper aims to explore spectral methods for applications in architectural geometries. A novel methodology for generating anisotropic Laplacian operators based on regions of interest defined by the user is proposed. The potential of spectral methods in structural design is illustrated through design problems expressed on meshes and graphs.}
