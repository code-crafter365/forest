abstract = {New differential-recurrence relations for B-spline basis functions are given. Using these relations, a recursive method for finding the Bernstein-Bézier coefficients of B-spline basis functions over a single knot span is proposed. The algorithm works for any knot sequence and has an asymptotically optimal computational complexity. Numerical experiments show that the new method gives results which preserve a high number of digits when compared to an approach which uses the well-known de Boor-Cox formula.}
