abstract = {An essential premise for a reliable variation simulation is that information on the geometrical part variations and their accumulation and propagation within an assembly is available, accessible, interchangeable, and usable in all geometry-related downstream activities. For this reason, this article studies the potential of the QIF (Quality Information Framework) standard. It illustrates how it can be used in the sense of Model-Based Definition to close gaps in the digital geometry assurance process. Besides benefits in the automation of variation simulation, it demonstrates that the semantic, feature-based linkage between product specification and inspection information in QIF 3.0 facilitates the augmentation of variation simulation with more detailed feature information for pre-production applications and feeding the digital twin to assure and optimize product quality in the production phase.}
