abstract = {Innovative load-bearing structures often emerge from a fine balance between creative forms and engineering principles. While preference-based topology optimization methods have advanced structural design by considering designers’ geometric preferences, they struggle with visualizing and editing complex 3D details crucial for diverse design options. To overcome this bottleneck, here we propose the improved bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization considering subjective preferences (ISP-BESO) method. This method introduces a similarity constraint that enables precise control over subjective preferences in optimized structures. Then, a design exploration strategy is proposed by integrating virtual reality (VR) with topology optimization for the interactive creation of desirable 3D structures. The strategy employs VR sculpting to offer immersive visualization and real-time feedback, guiding material redistribution during optimization. This workflow can iteratively produce innovative and efficient structures. Adjusting target similarity in ISP-BESO steers designs toward performance-driven or preference-driven outcomes. A museum design example demonstrates the practical potential of this strategy.}
