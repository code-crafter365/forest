abstract = {Temporary bar structures made of reusable standardized components are widely used in construction, events, and exhibitions. They are economical, easy to assemble, and can be disassembled and reused in various structural arrangements for various purposes. However, existing reusable temporary structures are either limited to modular yet repetitive designs or require bespoke components, which restricts their reuse potential. Instead of designing bespoke kit of parts for limited reuse, this paper investigates how to design and build diverse freeform structures from one homogeneous kit of parts. We propose a computational framework to generate multi-tangent bar structures, a widely used jointing system, which allows bars to be joined at any point along their length with standard connectors. We present a mathematical formulation and a numerical scheme to optimize the bar spatial positions and contact assignment simultaneously, while ensuring that the constraints of tangency, collision, joint connectivity, and bar length are satisfied. Together with simulated case studies, we present two physical prototypes that reuse the same kit of parts using an augmented reality-guided assembly workflow.}
