abstract = {CAD assembly models are typically represented as a collection of components, each of which can share geometric interfaces with others. In the literature, geometric interfaces have been shown to play a fundamental role in assembly model analysis, component characterization, and classification. While these interfaces are not explicitly defined in CAD models, they can be inferred from the relative positioning of components. The resulting geometric interfaces can be categorized as either interference or contact. However, it is often unclear whether these interfaces stem from intentional design choices related to component shape and function, from consistently applied relative positioning, or from unintended errors. In industrial practice, the design of complex products often involves models sourced from public catalogs for third-party components. These catalog models frequently include shape simplifications, which can lead to unintended intersections or clearances with surrounding components — deviations that do not exist in the final physical product. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and formalization of geometric interfaces, based on the complementary roles of CAD assembly modules and digital component catalogs, both widely used in industry as foundational resources for generating assembly models. The results are directly applicable to industrial CAD assembly models and can serve as a reference for CAD developers seeking to improve and extend assembly processing, as well as for researchers conducting assembly analysis. This work introduces a formalization of geometric interfaces, including contacts, interferences, and interface envelopes, which are essential for defining component mounting requirements. An analysis of geometric interface perturbations caused by repetition operators is performed, leading to the concept of an interface envelope to model specific interface repetitions. The nominal assembly representation, presented as a reference model, facilitates the formalization of interface consistency, supporting more robust reasoning processes.}
