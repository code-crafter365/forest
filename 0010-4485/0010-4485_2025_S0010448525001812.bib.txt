abstract = {Porous structures originating from triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs), referred to as TPMS-like porous structures, have been widely applied across various domains due to their advantageous structural properties. However, the limited morphological diversity and the simulation challenges posed by the complex features have impeded the further development and practical utilization of TPMS-like porous structures. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have demonstrated remarkable potential for creativity in industrial design. Capitalizing on these developments, we propose Gen-Porous - a novel framework employing implicit neural representations (INR) to design and optimize TPMS-like porous structures. The proposed methodology delineates a comprehensive paradigm for the acquisition and synthesis of various TPMS-like porous structures through Implicit Neural Representation (INR), facilitating simulation-driven optimization in a meshfree manner directly within the acquired latent space. Initially, we collect a dataset comprising multiscale TPMS-like porous structures, employing implicit functions to achieve this. Subsequently, we utilize an Auto-Decoder network architecture to encode these structures into a compact latent space via implicit neural representation learning, thereby permitting the generation of novel configurations with augmented morphological diversity. Moreover, we develop a differentiable computational framework using neural meshfree simulations. This integration not only makes optimization more efficient, but also simplifies sensitivity analysis through automatic differentiation, enabling diverse constraints and objectives to be more easily incorporated. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework through a lightweight design case study, where optimized solutions are identified through latent space exploration. The core innovation lies in the neural unification of representation and simulation, achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency by circumventing traditional meshing bottlenecks and enabling full differentiability.}
