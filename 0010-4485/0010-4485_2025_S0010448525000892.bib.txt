abstract = {This paper extends the generalized NURBS representation to support local refinement via truncation hierarchical mechanism. The new representation is called truncated hierarchical GNURBS (TH-GNURBS), which provides adaptive refinement on arbitrary topological unstructured quadrilateral control mesh with non-uniform knot intervals. To construct TH-GNURBS, this paper builds the hierarchical structure and applies the truncation mechanism for highly localized refinement. During the construction, we modify TH-GNURBS basis functions to maintains the continuity around the extraordinary points (EPs). The TH-GNURBS basis functions satisfy partition of unity, C2 everywhere except G1 at the local region surrounding EPs. Finally, we provide a fitting algorithm to approximate an arbitrary triangle mesh with TH-GNURBS. Experimental results show that higher fitting accuracy with fewer control points via adaptive spline surface fitting.}
