abstract = {Rough machining, which directly determines overall subtractive machining efficiency, aims to efficiently remove 70%–90% of the stock material to approximate the final workpiece geometry. Prior mainstream tool path generation algorithms for roughing primarily adopt the Contour Parallel method, which can ensure quality but generate curved paths with frequent acceleration/deceleration, limiting efficiency. To address this challenge, this paper presents a comprehensive high-efficiency rough machining framework that optimizes tool retraction count (idle paths) and path smoothness (encouraging linear trajectories in material-removal zones to enhance feedrates), is compatible with multiple tools and generates single start-end tool paths for simply connected regions. Experiments show an efficiency gain of >14% over the Contour Parallel method, effectively resolving the core trade-off of balancing quality and efficiency in the rough machining phase.}
