abstract = {The study of ballistic personal protections often only focuses on the mechanical response and ballistic limits of the armor considered. However, understanding the armor-carrier interaction under dynamic conditions remains underexplored. This research analyzes non-penetrating ballistic impacts on gelatin samples involving multi-ply composite ballistic protection panels, focusing on biomechanical damage. For this purpose, ballistic gelatin is presented as a reliable soft tissue simulant and thoroughly examined under non-penetrating ballistic impact conditions. The methodology includes two experimental approaches: (1) low-velocity impact tests using rigid projectiles to isolate gelatin’s mechanical behavior and (2) high-velocity impact tests with steel spherical projectiles, involving additionally ballistic protection panels and a simplified bone surrogate as a hard tissue simulant. Due to the complexity of experimentally assessing the dynamic interaction between soft and hard tissue simulants, protection, and projectiles, an explicit finite element model has been developed. These simulations incorporate different damage models in composite protection and bone surrogate to accurately replicate the experimental tests. In addition, a proposed visco-hyperelastic constitutive model for ballistic gelatin is validated, generating a powerful predictive tool for evaluating ballistic protection and biomechanical damage. This work provides a comprehensive study of the behind armor blunt trauma and introduces an experimental methodology to quantify the mechanical response of ballistic gelatin and hard tissue simulants under non-penetrating ballistic impacts. It addresses a key gap in modeling soft tissue simulants under high-energy conditions and validates the corresponding visco-hyperelastic constitutive model. Findings highlight the importance of considering hard tissue effects when evaluating composite protection performance, which has not been previously addressed in literature. This work proposes an alternative evaluation framework to the assessment of advanced armor and biomechanical phenomena estimation. We further provide a deeper biomechanical insight in comparison with existing standards, bridging the gap between multi-layered composite protection and the human biomechanical response.}
