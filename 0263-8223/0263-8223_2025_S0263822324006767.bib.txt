abstract = {Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have achieved substantial developments in transforming solar energy into electrical power in recent years, resulting in their widespread application in various interdisciplinary engineering applications. However, the ongoing challenge lies in developing effective mathematical computations to analyze their mechanical behavior under various working scenarios, particularly for nonlinear problems. Being together with the fast growth of new conjugated materials aimed at improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solar cells, understanding their mechanical features is crucial for achieving optimal and reliable designs. In this study, we focus on (1) presenting a newly designed PSC structure based on nature-inspired triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) architectures with agglomerated CNTs reinforcement and (2) investigating a NURBS-based isogeometric approach to determine nonlinear bending and free vibration responses with size-dependent effects. The PSC structures are modeled as a multi-layered microplate, including thin solar cells and a functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced TPMS (FG-CNTR-TPMS) substrate layer. After deriving FG-CNTR-TPMS architectures, the strong and weak forms of the geometrically nonlinear behavior of microplates under static bending and free vibration with large amplitude conditions are established. The high performance and accuracy of the current approach are compared with the analytic approach and other available solutions. The obtained results demonstrated that the size effects significantly influence static deflections as well as frequencies of advanced PSC structures. In addition, the significant contribution of high-performance FG-CNTR-TPMS substrates in improving the size-dependent nonlinear performance of the original PSCs structure is discussed and elucidated.}
