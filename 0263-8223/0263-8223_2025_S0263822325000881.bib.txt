abstract = {This study presents lightweight designs using the tensegrity paradigm for the simply supported problem. Three tensegrity solutions are explored: super-structures, sub-structures, and cable-structures. The basic units of the three kinds are first studied, where we analytically calculate the minimal mass required, along with the optimal inclinations angles, to sustain a simply supported load. By applying self-similar rules and varying the structure subdivisions and complexities, the structure mass is further minimized under bar-yielding and buckling constraints. This study finds the optimal complexities and subdivisions of the three solutions. Numerical results validate and compare the minimal mass designs. These proposed lightweight designs are applicable to bridge designs and other scenarios that undergo simply supported loads.}
