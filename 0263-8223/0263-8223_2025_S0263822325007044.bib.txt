abstract = {Origami-inspired design provides a novel approach for structures that combine rigidity and flexibility, suitable for aerospace and robotics applications. Despite extensive research on origami, its use in cellular lattices remains limited, as standalone origami tubes often exhibit buckling and reduced mechanical properties, limiting their energy absorption. This study addresses these issues by proposing hierarchical origami-inspired planar-based lattices (OIPLs) that inherently fulfil design for manufacturability (DFM) requirements through the use of interpenetrating curved crease origami tubes. These structures enhance specific energy absorption (SEA) at low relative densities, making them ideal for lightweight aerospace applications. Arranging the primary origami tube into three distinct tessellations created hierarchical lattices with ordered voids featuring 4, 6, and 8 corners, resulting in lattices named Rhomboid (RB), Hexavoid (HV), and Octavoid (OV), respectively. These hierarchical lattices were fabricated using material extrusion additive manufacturing techniques at a 15 % relative density (RD) and tested under quasi-static compression, with a honeycomb (HC) lattice serving as a benchmark. Although the HV lattice showed a 6 % lower SEA and a 23 % lower modulus compared to HC, it exhibited stable plateau stresses and reduced peak stress, both essential for energy absorption. Among the OIPLs, HV achieved the highest performance, with a 28 % increase in SEA and a 9 % increase in modulus. Further analysis of HV revealed that lower top-edge angles (α) and higher RDs improved buckling resistance, while increased angles and RDs yielded SEA values up to 19 J/g, approximately 82 % higher than those obtained using origami tubes. Additionally, reducing the RB unit cell size at 15 % RD resulted in a 24 % SEA improvement over HC, while the HV lattice with more unit cells (N = 4) at the same RD demonstrated a 35 % SEA enhancement over HC.}
