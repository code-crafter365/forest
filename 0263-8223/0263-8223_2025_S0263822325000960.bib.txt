abstract = {Auxetic (negative Poisson’s ratio) structures made from rotating squares have attracted considerable attention due to their tunable shape control, strength, and strain energy absorption capacity. The present study aims to explore the interrelations between mesoscale kinematics and the macroscopic mechanical behavior of additively manufactured rotating-square auxetics under compressive loads. Specifically, correlations between the rotational degree of freedom of the squares, mechanical deformation of the cell hinges, and the macroscopic nonlinear mechanical and Poisson’s behaviors are investigated using experimental measurements supplemented by mathematical models. Structures with variable cell hinge thicknesses are fabricated by stereolithography additive manufacturing technique and then subjected to compressive loads applied at quasi-static and dynamic conditions with several orders of magnitude difference in strain rate. Multiscale mechanical deformation of the structure in each case is analyzed using digital image correlation (DIC). Experimental characterizations indicate strongly nonlinear and rate-sensitive auxetic behaviors in the examined structures. The role of cell hinge thickness is discussed in terms of the mechanical constraint that these components impose on the rotational degree of freedom of the solid squares in the structure, concurrently causing a nonlinear strain hardening behavior.}
