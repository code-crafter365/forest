abstract = {Nanoparticle-reinforced composites (NPRCs) have attracted significant interest as an alternative to conventional materials due to excellent mechanical properties. However, there is no mature finite element-based computational method to evaluate the strength and energy absorption properties of NPRCs, especially not taking into account the influence of interfacial effects. We developed a new finite interface element considering interface curvature dependence and established a simulation method for calculating the Young’s modulus and yield strength of NPRCs. We investigated the impact of nanoparticle modulus, geometric distribution, and interface effects on the Young’s modulus, yield strength, and energy absorption characteristics of NPRCs. The results indicate interface bending stiffness moderately enhances the Young’s modulus of NPRCs, but this enhancement diminishes as particle modulus increases. Additionally, the Young’s modulus of NPRC usually increases with the addition of particles, thus, significant particle agglomeration markedly reduces it. Furthermore, interface bending stiffness increases strain energy density in NPMs but decreases its energy absorption efficiency. The thin-walled structure within nanoporous materials (NPMs) is particularly susceptible to buckling under external loads, which markedly increases dependence of yield strength on surface bending stiffness. This study provides a robust, scientifically validated approach to accurately predict the mechanical properties of advanced composite.}
