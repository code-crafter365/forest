abstract = {A new mesoscale simulation method for moisture absorption, hygrothermal aging and mechanical degradation of three-dimensional five-directional (3D5D) hybrid braided composites is proposed in this paper. According to the Micro-CT measurements, a mesoscale representative volume element (RVE) model containing axial yarns, braiding yarns, matrix and interfaces is established. Based on the Fick’s second law of diffusion, the interior moisture diffusion process and concentration field can be calculated and introduced to the subsequent simulation. A mesoscale moisture-thermal–mechanical coupled progressive damage model is developed to predict the hygrothermal stress, aging damage and mechanical degradation. The numerical simulation results of moisture absorption, hygrothermal aging damage and tensile property degradation have good agreement with experimental results, demonstrating the validity of the developed method. The fatigue property degradation and damage evolution process can also be predicted by the developed method. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the maximum residual hygrothermal stress could reach 677.71 MPa, resulting in the irreversible aging damage dominated by matrix cracking and interfacial debonding. It further causes the elastic modulus degradation of 29.8 %, ultimate strength degradation of 32.8 % and fatigue strength degradation exceeding 37.1 %, as well as earlier damage initiation and faster damage propagation in the aged composites.}
