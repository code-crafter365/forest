abstract = {This study presents a new framework designed to optimize fiber orientation in brittle materials, with an emphasis on post-fracture behavior. It integrates phase-field fracture modeling with topology optimization to enhance the mechanical performance of fiber-reinforced concrete by more effectively managing crack propagation. The framework utilizes a novel constitutive model based on phase-field theory, which represents damage evolution in brittle materials. The optimization process involves a multi-objective function that balances structural stiffness with damage mitigation. Numerical simulations show that the optimized fiber orientation improves fracture resistance and stiffness, even after crack initiation, thereby extending the overall durability of the structure.}
