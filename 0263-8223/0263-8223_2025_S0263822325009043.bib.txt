abstract = {The increasing number of decommissioned wind turbine blades (DWTBs) presents significant environmental and disposal challenges. This study evaluates the residual mechanical properties ofGFRPcomposites extracted from the spar cap of a 1.5 MW GE37 wind turbine blade after 11 years of service.An experimental program was conducted including tensile, compressive, flexural, and short beam shear tests in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Longitudinal specimens retained high tensile strength (621 MPa), compressive strength (372 MPa), and modulus (37.5 GPa), representing 76–96 % of pristine GFRP values.In contrast,the transverse directionspecimen exhibited relatively lower mechanical properties due to the anisotropic nature of the composite material. The characteristic values of the mechanical properties were estimated using the t-distribution method at 80 % and 90 % confidence levels providing a statistically reliable lower bound for conservative and safe design applications. The anisotropic behavior of the composites was clearly observed, reinforcing the importance of fiber orientation in load-bearing applications. These findings confirm the potential for reusing DWTB composites in secondary structural elements, particularly in civil infrastructure applications. By demonstrating retained structural capacity, this study supports circular economy initiatives and provides engineers with the necessary data for integrating recycled composites into sustainable construction practices.}
