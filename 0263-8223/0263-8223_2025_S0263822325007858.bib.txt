abstract = {Phase field model has currently demonstrated potential in failure analysis of composite materials. However, fine meshes are required to ensure accuracy, which leads to a sharp increase in computational effort. In order to improve the computational efficiency, this work proposes an adaptive phase field model based on the remeshing technique for constant/variable stiffness composite laminates. First, according to the difference in the effect of various failure modes of composite materials on strain energy, a new elastic strain energy splitting strategy is proposed, the relation between penalty parameter and stress is re-derived. Secondly, an adaptive solution is constructed and the adaptive remeshing technique is applied. The distribution of the mesh is considered from a global perspective. According to the changes in physical quantities and error distribution in the entire computational domain, the mesh resources are redistributed, which improves the computational accuracy while reducing unnecessary computational workload. Meanwhile, an adaptive time increment strategy is adopted, and a coupling criterion is proposed to automatically adjust the time increment with the mesh size and phase field value. Finally, the presented strategy is adopted to the failure analysis of constant and variable stiffness composite materials. The results show that the presented adaptive remeshing technique is not affected by the sample, and the mesh is refined along the fiber direction, which greatly reduces the number of elements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the adaptive scheme.}
