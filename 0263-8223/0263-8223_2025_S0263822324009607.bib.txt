abstract = {Numerous intricate fiber architectures for composite preforms can be generated by the three-dimensional rotary braiding technique due to the individually controllable horn gear mechanism. Herein, a methodology for mesoscopic morphology prediction is presented to investigate the internal geometry of these architectures. The methodology involves an algorithm for carrier path prediction, a fiber element considering dynamics, the modifications of contact detection and the design of a friction force model. Furthermore, the accuracy of structure predictions for three types of fabrics is validated and the inner structure simulation is verified using X-ray CT scanning. Two representative unit cells for fabric characterization are proposed and parametric equations are established to describe the structure of unit cells. The parametric studies illustrate the significant influences of increase in horn gear slot number on the yarn number, the overall size of unit cell and the yarn volume fraction, but few effects on the yarn group.}
