abstract = {This paper delineates the development of two analytical models concerning two parameters of Textile-Reinforced Cementitious matrix composites (TRC): load-transfer length and crack width. Load-transfer length is defined as the segment where load shifts from the textile to the matrix, thereby influencing crack number, spacing, and width of TRC. The models consider the mechanical and geometrical properties of TRC, the interlayer thicknesses, the damage energy dissipation, and the shear at the textile-to-matrix interface. The validation process entailed a comparison of the models with experimental data derived from nine TRC configurations, incorporating diverse matrices, textiles, and reinforcement ratios. Embedded distributed fibre optic sensors in TRC were utilised to monitor the textile and matrix strains, thereby facilitating the measurement of the load-transfer length. Digital Image Correlation was employed to assess crack widths. Subsequently, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the impact of TRC components on these parameters. The findings of this study indicate that stronger textile-to-matrix bonds, higher textile and matrix stiffness, and increased reinforcement ratios reduce transfer length and crack widths. However, increasing matrix strength results in wider cracks. These insights will aid in optimising material choices and textile layouts for TRC, thus enhancing its use in strengthening civil engineering structures.}
