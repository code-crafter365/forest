abstract = {Curved honeycomb sandwich structures with larger surface areas effectively reduce the number of fasteners and connectors, resulting in weight reduction, cost savings, and reliability improvement. Square honeycombs exhibit higher in-plane tensile strength, and are more compatible with mechanical components. Topology optimization can realize the variable-density design of square honeycombs, enhancing the strength and stiffness of curved sandwich structures, but the high-order Rational Approximation of Material Properties (RAMP) interpolation model with a fast convergence rate has the relatively poor clarity and stability in topology boundaries. Hence, a variable-density topology optimization method based on the improved high-order RAMP model is developed for curved square honeycomb sandwich structures. The high-order RAMP interpolation model is improved by incorporating a minimum modulus term into the material interpolation function and employing the Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) to refine the Optimality Criteria (OC) method. A functional relationship between the wall thickness of cross-shaped cells (i.e., simplified models of four adjacent square cells arranged in a cross) and the relative density of topology units is constructed using a density mapping method, and the topology optimization with the relative density of cross-shaped cells as the design variable is performed to minimize the compliance of the core. Three-point bending tests are conducted on 3D printed non-optimized and optimized curved honeycomb sandwich structures with different core material retention rates and panel thicknesses, and the experimental results are compared with those of simulations to explore the bending properties and failure behaviors. The results indicate that the modified high-order RAMP interpolation model enhances the clarity and stability of topology structures, the variable-density topology optimization significantly improves the bending properties of curved square honeycomb sandwich structures, and the experimental and numerical results are largely consistent.}
