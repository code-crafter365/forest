abstract = {The durability of thermal barrier coatings—a critical layered composite system in aero-engines and gas turbines—is governed by the evolution of thermally grown oxides (TGOs). This process transitions from the formation of protective alumina to the destabilizing growth of mixed oxides (e.g, Cr2O3), exhibiting abrupt growth rate and nonlinear oxidation kinetics. A novel bidirectional diffusion–reaction framework is presented to integrate oxygen and metal diffusion, large deformation mechanics, and multiphysics coupling for modeling TGO evolution. The framework comprehensively assesses the oxidation process, from alumina formation to Cr2O3 growth, elucidating critical phenomena including aluminum depletion thresholds, breakaway oxidation progression, and interfacial stress evolution. Validation against Hille’s and Evans’s methodologies, i.e., anion- and cation-dominant diffusion–reaction mechanisms, confirms the model’s accuracy. During inward oxidation, alumina grew 1.62 times faster in peaks than in troughs. Following the onset of breakaway oxidation, rapid Cr2O3 growth occurred with trough regions exhibiting growth rates 1.96 times higher than those at peak regions. Furthermore, the framework reveals how Cr2O3 formation exacerbates interfacial stresses through concentration dynamics during outward oxidation, inducing stress reversals and localized tensile peaks. By incorporating uneven TGO morphology and microstructural heterogeneity, the model provides insights into optimizing bond coat composition and composite architecture (e.g., graded layers or reactive element doping) to suppress breakaway oxidation and delay spallation.}
