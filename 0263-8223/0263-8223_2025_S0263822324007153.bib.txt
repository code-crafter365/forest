abstract = {Broadband and efficient electromagnetic wave absorbers have always been a hot research topic due to their wide application needs. Herein, silicon carbide fiber (SiCf) and carbon fiber (Cf) were introduced to construct a composite fibers structure. The structure supports the resonant modes and regulates the electromagnetic energy dissipation through the coordination of SiCf and Cf. Based on pure absorption mechanisms, the single layer structure realizes the efficient absorption with reflection loss less than −10 dB within the 10.6–18 GHz frequency band, and the double layer structure has an efficient absorption band of 11 GHz. Experimental and numerical analysis show that SiCf and Cf generate different resonance modes and loss mechanisms respectively under the excitation of incident electromagnetic field, which can complement and enhance energy dissipation over a wide frequency range, ultimately achieving the broadband absorption performance of the structure. The composite fibers structure proposed in this paper has the advantages of simple structure, easy preparation, small outline, lightweight, and broadband efficient absorption. In addition, it provides a new idea for the design of composite fibers structure for electromagnetic wave absorption.}
