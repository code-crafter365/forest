abstract = {A 3D parametrised description of out-of-plane waviness defects in carbon/thermoplastic laminates is proposed based on computed tomography (CT) images and micrograph observations of specimen edges. The geometrical parameters are identified automatically by maximizing the similarity between virtual images of the composite generated with the geometrical model and the images of the real material. The identification procedure is able to deal with the limited quality of the CT images caused by the low contrast between the carbon fibres and the thermoplastic matrix. The proposed geometrical model describes well the whole 3D geometry of the generated waviness defects with some local deviations, but minor discrepancies in the local orientation of the plies. Based on the obtained geometries, Finite Element models are generated at the ply scale of the laminates including the waviness defect. Numerical simulation of the stress fields in the defect zone under tensile loading yield stress concentrations and orientations of the local maximum tensile stress that agree well with experimentally observed crack locations and orientations.}
