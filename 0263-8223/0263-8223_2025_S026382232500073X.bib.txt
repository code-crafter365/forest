abstract = {We propose a thermodynamically consistent phase-field fracture (PFF) formulation for elastoplastic solids undergoing ductile fracture. Modelling the degradation of epoxy in the micromechanical analysis of fibre-reinforced polymer composites is of specific interest. To emulate the experimentally observed pressure-sensitive plastic deformation and stress-state-based failure initiation in an epoxy matrix, we define a novel phase-field driving energy that utilizes a combination of a local damage propagation indicator and an energy barrier dependent on both local damage onset criterion and types of phase-field regularization. We present a set of analytical investigations on a one-dimensional model to draw comprehensive insight into the roles played by different critical elements in the governing equation of phase-field. Numerical experiments on homogeneous epoxy specimens and microscopic volume elements (MVEs) of unidirectional fibre-reinforced polymer composites are performed, and the correctness of the proposed model’s predictions is verified by comparing them with results obtained from one of the established local continuum damage models. The effect of MVE’s size in determining the values of peak stress and failure strain is also demonstrated. The fracture angles and modes show coherence with experimental observations, establishing the utility and correctness of the proposed model in the micro-mechanical analysis of composites.}
