abstract = {3D warp interlock woven fabrics (3D WIFs) are gaining popularity as composite reinforcements for their superior strength and delamination resistance, but a clear structural classification is essential to fully understand and utilize their potential in high-performance composites. This study introduces a new parameter, providing high-order definition and architectural classification. It redefines new surface warps as regular warps that are flexible in their positioning, as they connect to only one layer and eliminates the need for traditional reinforcing fabric design theory. The study also introduces the concept of wefts per column to accommodates varying layers within the structure, and an index to repeat the number of columns in the representative elementary pattern. A new parameter is introduced to define the weft insertion order, which directly influences the reinforcement behaviour. The study also considers the evolution of warps per column, allowing precise tracking of warp positions and inter-ply location changes within each column. These refinements enable the development of versatile and innovative 3D woven composite reinforcements with both regular and irregular numbers of weft yarns per column. Such features open new vistas for developing complex architectures in advanced composites, suitable for a wide range of applications including defence, aerospace, automotive, and more.}
