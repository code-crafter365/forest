abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that externally wrapped high-tensile materials, such as fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) and steel, can significantly improve the strength and ductility of concrete columns. However, the full potential of the superior mechanical properties of FRP composites remains under-exploited. This study introduces an innovative high ductile FRP-concrete composite column (HDFRP-CCC), which simply involves replacing conventional FRP tubes with newly proposed high ductile FRP developed by the author without any additional construction measures. Axial compression tests on HDFRP-CCC are conducted to assess the effectiveness of this composite column. The test results revealed that, compared to conventional FRP-CCC, HDFRP-CCC exhibits larger axial deformation (i.e., ultimate strain > 0.15), and the rate of stress increase rises more rapidly with increasing strain before reaching the strength. Furthermore, it was observed that the strength of HDFRP-CCC with a square section is significantly enhanced (i.e., peak stress > 1.5 times plain concrete strength), while that of conventional FRP-CCC with a square section is difficult to increase due to the arching effect. The HDFRP-CCC proposed in this study has higher load-bearing capacity and safety margin than conventional FRP-CCC, which is anticipated to address the current limitations of FRP-CCC in mechanical properties.}
