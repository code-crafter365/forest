abstract = {This study investigates the bending performance degradation of curvilinear fiber composite (CFC) laminates caused by delamination under uncertainties in material, geometric, and composite characteristics. Using a nonlinear finite element (NL FE) framework with improved first-order shear deformation theory, the analysis explores the impact of delamination modeled with the sublaminate method across critical regions of CFC plates. The tow-angle layup configurations of two fiber curvature profiles (anti-symmetric and asymmetric) of periodically loaded (sinusoidal) CFC laminates are optimized utilizing the artificial bee colony method. The continuous distribution of in-plane stresses is governed by the super convergent patch recovery method. A Latin hypercube sampling benefited machine learning (support vector regression)-based NL FE surrogate model accelerates stochastic evaluations, replacing computationally demanding Monte Carlo simulations, a traditional method of randomness prediction. Sensitivity analyses reveal distinct influences of material and geometric uncertainties on deflection and stresses, providing valuable insights for robust CFC laminate design under uncertain conditions. The superior performance is achieved for asymmetric fiber path CFC laminates with significant influence of material characteristics.}
