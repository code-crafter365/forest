abstract = {The invisible damage caused by low-velocity impacts are safety threats to engineering structures. Thus, impact force identification is crucial in the context of composite structures for both structure health monitoring (SHM) and composite structure design. This paper investigates the process of identifying impacts on composite structures subjected to low-velocity impact. Considering the damage evolution in the composite structure during impact, this paper explores the influence of impact damage on the accuracy of force identification. Impact experiments on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates were conducted to obtain impact force peaks and displacement responses. Furthermore, a validated finite element model (FEM) is established for more elaborate analysis on the mechanism. The findings reveal that the structural damage can lead to significant deviations in force identification if the damage is not considered. Finally, a neural network is employed to predict the force history taking impact damage into consideration. This research provides a reference for the composite structures design and health monitoring of engineering structures considering impact damage.}
