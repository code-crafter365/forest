abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model for predicting the nonlinear tensile response and progressive failure modes of multidirectional laminates. The proposed method extends the unidirectional pseudo-ductility model to multidirectional laminates and captures the complete failure process by taking accounts of various failure modes, including fiber breakage, matrix transverse failure, free-edge delamination, and potential intermediate layer fragmentation and delamination. Combining the matrix nonlinearity with fiber fracture and delamination in the intermediate layer, the [±θn/0°m/±θn] configuration theoretically exhibits the highest uniaxial tensile pseudo-ductility, which is influenced by factors such as ply thickness, ply angle, and proportion of plies. Tensile testing on specimens with various thin-ply [±θn/0°2/±θn] configurations were conducted to validate the accuracy of the prediction model. The results showed a good agreement in the stress–strain responses. Furthermore, the [±30°6/0°2/±30°6] configuration exhibited intermediate ply fragmentation with a pseudo-ductile strain of 4.04 %, while other configurations with higher 0° ply proportions experienced catastrophic delamination or fracture. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) results illustrated the strain evolution process, showing progressive delamination for the [±30°6/0°2/±30°6] configuration and catastrophic delamination for the [±30°4/0°2/±30°4] configuration. The analytical approach offers a straightforward method for capturing failure modes and stress–strain responses, facilitating pseudo-ductility design in multidirectional laminates.}
