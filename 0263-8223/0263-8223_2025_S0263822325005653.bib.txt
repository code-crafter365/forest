abstract = {This work proposes an explicit topology optimization approach for designing flexoelectric energy harvesters with graded lattice structure under finite deformation. The proposed approach integrates Moving Morphable Component (MMC) method with Partitioned Coordinate Mapping (PCM) functions. This integration achieves precise representation of the graded distribution of flexoelectric materials in optimization. Capitalizing on the local support and high-order continuity properties of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) basis functions, the approach enables the generation of diverse cell topologies across partitioned subdomains. It ensures both well-defined structural boundaries and seamless connections between adjacent cells. This provides a larger solution space for the design of graded lattice structures, especially under finite deformation. The Newton-Raphson method is implemented to solve geometric nonlinear governing equations for flexoelectric systems. An ersatz material model is also developed by combining Isogeometric analysis (IGA) with the explicit geometry description to meet the C1 continuity requirement of the high-order flexoelectric partial differential equations (PDEs). Computational efficiency is enhanced through a technique that removes redundant degrees of freedom (DOFs). By removing the redundant DOFs in the computation process, the singularities stemming from so-called weak elements can be prevented. The explicit geometric parametrization allows direct additive manufacturing of optimized structures for subsequent experimental validation. Both numerical examples and experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the approach in enhancing the performance of the flexoelectric energy harvesters.}
