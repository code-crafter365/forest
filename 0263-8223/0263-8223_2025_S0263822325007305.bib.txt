abstract = {As typical heterogeneous composites, traditional material parameter identification of the biological tissues has recently been challenged by the popularization of full-field measurements during experimental tests. The Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) method, which is known for its robustness, has to face prohibitive computational costs with the massive data offered by full-field measurements. A promising alternative is the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) which is notably more efficient computationally when these full-field measurements are available. We recently proposed a general and robust VFM framework for identifying the material parameters of nonlinear elasticity. However, the framework was formulated with the spatial form of the principle of virtual power. In the current paper, we introduce a more concise formulation with the material form of the principle of virtual power, expanding the application to multiple measurement cases. Verification with analytical and numerical examples demonstrates its significant efficiency compared to the FEMU method as well as generality and robustness across various applications, including the noise sensitivity analysis and heterogeneous biological tissue cases. The accurate identification results highlight the significant potential of this method in nonlinear biological composites.}
