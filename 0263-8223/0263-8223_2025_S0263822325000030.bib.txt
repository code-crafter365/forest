abstract = {In this paper, we propose an isogeometric boundary element method for the homogenization of linear viscoelastic composites. We extend the simple-domain boundary element method, originally designed for elastic composites, to linear viscoelastic composite. To reduce computational cost, the multi-domain-based simple-domain boundary element method is also presented. Based on a simple homogenization strategy, we use the Prony series to approximate the macroscopic effective relaxation tensor. The isogeometric boundary element method is particularly suitable for homogenization because it has the advantages of boundary-only discretization, easy implementation of periodic boundary conditions, exact geometric representations, and high-order continuity. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through 2D and 3D numerical examples.}
