abstract = {Direct Ink Writing (DIW) combines the flexibility of 3D printing with increased material applications such as thermoset carbon fiber composites, ceramic composites, and metals. The usefulness of direct ink writing, like many additive manufacturing (AM) processes, remains limited for reasons ranging from quality control to lack of process parameter optimization. This study looks to introduce a methodology for characterizing direct ink written carbon fiber composites to facilitate exploration into the relationships between process parameters and material structure. The presented study utilized nine 3D specimens of direct ink writing carbon fiber composites printed with varying process parameters – speed differential, layer height, step-over distance, and nozzle diameter – as the data set. The data was collected with an automatic serial sectioning system, LEROY, from the Air Force Research Laboratory. The collected data was processed in DREAM.3D and analyzed with statistical comparisons of 2D orientation distributions of the fibers, 2D size distributions of the voids, and 2D shape distributions of the voids.}
