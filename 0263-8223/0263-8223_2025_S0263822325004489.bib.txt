abstract = {The mechanical properties of the composites exhibit progressive degradation accompanied by significant stochasticity as cycles increase during fatigue loadings. Potential fatigue life characteristics from material degradation uncertainty were investigated to reduce the error of residual life prediction. A physics-data-driven fatigue life prediction approach without a pre-prepared database for composite laminate has been established based on the proposed stochastic stiffness degradation model and Bayesian optimization. Optimization was utilized to extract disentangled latent stochastic features in stiffness degradation to represent the error of the damage accumulation model during fatigue life prediction. The established prediction model has been experimentally verified using 102 laminate specimens with several layups and materials, and the results show that the predicted life with different proportions of stiffness data input is in good agreement with experimental ones.}
