abstract = {Successful implementation of Liquid Composite Molding processes relies on a thorough knowledge of the flow and fiber-bed behavior, with unsaturated permeability being a key parameter. This paper presents a combined experimental–numerical method for the characterization of unsaturated through-thickness permeability of deformable engineering textiles. The experimental procedure, developed in a previous study, is based on visual tracking, and recording of flow-front advancement and eventual flow-induced fiber-bed deformation. This information, along with material and injection parameters, is fed to a numerical dual-scale flow model implemented using a finite volume scheme. The model considers different aspects of the impregnation, namely macro and micro flows between and inside fiber bundles, capillary flow, and fiber-bed deformation. The macro and micro permeability curves are obtained through an inverse method that considers different experimental parameters. The method is successfully applied on a glass fiber Non-Crimped-Fabric, where permeability results satisfy all the employed processing and material conditions.}
