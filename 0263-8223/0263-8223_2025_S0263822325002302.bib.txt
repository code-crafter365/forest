abstract = {In this paper, a finite element numerical model of the bending damage of ultraviolet-cured glass fiber reinforced (UV-CGFR) composites was developed based on the results of the three-point bending test and X-ray tomography (Micro-CT), as well as infrared thermography (IRT) and other microscopic and macroscopic characterization tests. The numerical model, incorporating the three-dimensional Hashin failure criterion via the VUMAT subroutine, was established to predict the bending failure process and damage energy of UV-CGFR composites from the perspectives of fracture damage and energy dissipation. The effects of curing time, UV irradiation intensity, and loading rate on the bending properties and bending failure mechanism of UV-CGFR composites were systematically investigated. The primary failure modes observed were resin compression-tensile fractures, fiber tensile fractures, interlaminar debonding, and delamination. The bending strength and bending modulus of UV-CGFR composites increase and decrease with the increase of curing time and irradiation intensity; the bending strength increases with the loading rate, and the bending modulus is less affected by the loading rate. The temperature rise effect generated by fiber tensile fractures and interlaminar debonding was identified as a key factor contributing to the enhancement of bending strength. The temperature increase became more pronounced with higher loading rates, reaching a maximum rise of 5.2℃. Furthermore, the feasibility of UV-CGFR composites for pipeline repair was validated through pipe ring bending tests. The results show that the bending damage behaviour of UV-CGFR composites aligns well with real-world engineering applications, and the UV-CGFR composite lining repair significantly enhanced the pipeline’s load-bearing properties.}
