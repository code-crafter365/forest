abstract = {Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) pultruded profiles are increasingly utilized in civil engineering due to their light weight, high strength, and corrosion resistance. However, their anisotropic properties, quasi-brittle failure modes, and stress concentrations pose challenges in realizing efficient, convenient, and reliable joints, especially for widely utilized beam-column joints that bear complicated loads. The beam-column joint plays a crucial role as the foundation of pultruded FRP frame structures. This study comprehensively reviews various connection methods for plates, including bolted, bonded, hybrid, and other innovative types. Among them, hybrid connections exhibit superior mechanical properties and better application prospects. This work also reviews different connection methods of beam-column joints, such as direct connections, cleat/plate connections, and cuff/sleeve connections. To assess their performance, a database comprising nearly 200 beam-column joints is established, along with a proposed evaluation method that focuses on critical indicators including strength, stiffness, weight, space utilization, and material cost. Direct connections are straightforward but exhibit only moderate mechanical performance. Cleat/plate connections are the most thoroughly researched, generally presenting limited mechanical performance. Cuff/sleeve connections are troublesome to construct but offer the best mechanical performance. In practical applications, different connection methods can be selected based on specific requirements. Furthermore, this study reviews existing design guidelines and identifies an urgent need for joint design methods.}
