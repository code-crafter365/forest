abstract = {The use of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns reinforced with basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) jackets is increasingly prevalent in construction engineering. However, BFRP jackets are prone to physical damage during joint design or maintenance, which can weaken their confinement effect on CFST columns. Consequently, the damage parameters of BFRP jackets are crucial for the reinforcement of CFST structures. In this study, past experimental data were validated using a finite element model (FEM). Building on this reliable FEM, a comprehensive database was created, consisting of 495 data points, encompassing various damage conditions such as direction, location, angle, and quantity. A method for normalizing different damage parameters was proposed to quantitatively describe their respective damage characteristics. With the exception of the circumferential slotting damage type, all other damage types resulted in a degradation of the strengthened stiffness. Six machine learning methods were then employed to establish the capacity model, where Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost significantly outperform linear models, with R2 values exceeding 0.97. SHAP analysis reveals that the scale of vertical grooves and the regional damage coefficient are key factors influencing the prediction. The research can provide a theoretical basis for the design and maintenance of BFRP-CFST columns.}
