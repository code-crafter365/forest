abstract = {The paper establishes an elastic–plastic-damage model that incorporates the plasticity of carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composite (CFRTP) for fiber metal laminates (FML) to investigate the mechanical response and damage behavior of FML under low-velocity impacts. The Johnson-Cook elastic–plastic-damage parameters of aluminum alloys (Al) used in FML were determined through quasi-static tensile experiments on flat and notched specimens of Al, and the accuracy of the model parameters was verified through quasi-static tensile simulations. Based on the elastic–plastic-damage model of CFRTP, the elastic–plastic-damage model of Al and the cohesive zone model (CZM) of cohesive layer, a comprehensive elastic–plastic-damage model of FML was established. Off-axis tensile experiments and simulations were conducted to compare the results of considering and not considering CFRTP plasticity, demonstrating the necessity of considering plasticity. The accuracy of the model was validated through low-velocity impact experiments and simulations, with detailed analyses performed on the damage evolution process and damage mechanism of FML.}
