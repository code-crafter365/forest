abstract = {The development of high-strength carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (Gr)-metal composites is an urgent priority in contemporary aerospace and nuclear industries, as well as in electronic devices. Microstructural design aimed at enhancing strength has been a primary focus of research on metal matrix composites. In this study, laminated Gr-CNTs/tungsten (Gr-CNTs/W) nanocomposite structures with different configurations of CNTs are proposed, and their uniaxial tensile mechanical properties are tested using molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the stiffness and strength of Gr-CNTs/W nanocomposites are superior to those of pure W. The Young’s modulus, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength of Gr-CNTs/W nanocomposites with astroid-1 CNTs are greater than those of pure W by about 18.7 %, 31.9 %, and 6.2 %, respectively. The varying stress concentration effects resulting from the intersection of twin boundaries and CNTs during deformation lead to Gr-CNTs/W nanocomposites exhibiting different mechanical properties. At the temperature range of 300 K to 1500 K, the stiffness and strength of designed Gr-CNTs/W nanocomposites remain significantly superior to those of pure W, highlighting their excellent high-temperature mechanical properties and thermal stability. These studies assist in the design of the microstructure of metal matrix composites to achieve improvements in their mechanical properties.}
