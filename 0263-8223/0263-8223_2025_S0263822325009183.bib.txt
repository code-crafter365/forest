abstract = {We introduce a guided wave (GW)-based structural health monitoring (SHM) methodology for damage localization in curved composite laminates (CCL) in thermal conditions. The CCL panel was manufactured by vacuum-assisted resin infusion processing. Piezoelectric sensor arrays were designed to excite and capture GW signals in CCL at different temperatures. Based on a signal dimensionality reduction method, we employed an improved Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) method to retain critical waveform features with minimal distortion. The preprocessed signals were then converted into 2D images using the Gramian angular field (GAF) method. An improved Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) network featuring a novel delayed fusion mechanism for temperature compensation has been developed. Comprehensive interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was performed, during which the temperature influence mechanisms and channel importance were thoroughly explored, and the conversion effect on model performance of damage localization was further analyzed. The proposed method achieves 98.1% localization accuracy, with experimental results demonstrating that the delayed temperature compensation mechanism significantly enhances model generalizability, with an accuracy of 90% in unknown thermal environments. The findings provide valuable insights for developing robust SHM strategies for composite structures operating in thermal-variable conditions.}
