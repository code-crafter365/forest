abstract = {This study presents a novel fatigue design method to ensure that externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer-strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams achieve infinite fatigue life (>2 million cycles). It utilizes small-sample machine learning (ML) techniques to develop a classification model that predicts whether a sample’s fatigue life surpasses this threshold, emphasizing the importance of multiple variables beyond just stress or strain ranges applied to steel reinforcement and considering potential failure modes. A classification probability-stress level (P-S) curve, developed using the ML model, was constructed to estimate fatigue limits, enhancing model reliability with an average relative error of 6.05 %. Based on virtual data analysis, a new fatigue design equation was proposed, offering greater accuracy for infinite life design compared to existing guidelines. This improved accuracy stems from its foundation in strengthening beam-specific data and consideration of potential stress transfer issues between FRP and steel reinforcement due to FRP-concrete bond interface degradation. To enhance design reliability, it is recommended to use the new equation alongside existing ones. This approach provides a more comprehensive and accurate method for designing FRP-strengthened RC beams for infinite fatigue life.}
