abstract = {This paper develops a “magneto-electric-visco/elastic” coupled finite element (FE) model based on Zigzag hypothesis, investigating the vibration and damping characteristics of magneto-electric-elastic (MEE) sandwich structures with viscoelastic core. Three kinds of MEE sandwich plate/shell structures are considered according to the position of mid-surface, with both elastic and viscoelastic layers are assumed to be Reissner–Mindlin plates. The coordinate transformation matrices between the material and structural coordinate systems are established, enabling the calculation of arbitrary vertical fiber angles. Through the complex modulus approach, we have formulated the coupled “magneto-electric-visco/elastic” constitutive equations. The type of element employs an 8-node quadratic element with each node having 7 degrees of freedom (DOFs). Simulation results show that the natural frequency of the present model converges using only 0.44% of the three-dimensional (3-D) element model’s DOFs, with a deviation of merely 0.0025%. This study has important theoretical significance for the design and development of advanced MEE damping laminated structures.}
