abstract = {Electrically conductive polymer composites have emerged as a pivotal material in polymer science, offering enhanced properties by integrating conductive nanofillers with pure polymers. The material extrusion-based (MEX) 3D printing of these composites is well-known for yielding high-quality parts. In this study, a novel approach involving a modified four-extrusion strategy was utilized to synthesize a reinforced conductive poly(lactic) acid polymer composite with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and short glass fibers (SGFs). This work comprehensively studies the thermal degradation, thermodynamic, morphological, and electrical properties, alongside with a focus on optimizing the MEX 3D printing process for enhanced performance. Optimal printing parameters significantly influencing the surface roughness and tensile properties of the printed parts were found, including a layer thickness of 0.10 mm, a nozzle temperature of 205 °C, a flat print orientation, an infill speed of 72.55 mm/s, and an infill density of 99.9 %. The minimum surface roughness was achieved for the PLA composites is 3.67 µm (14.6 %) lower than the pure PLA. The incorporation of nanofillers will improve the layer deposition and accumulation of materials. The incorporation of reinforcements into the composite material resulted in substantial improvements in the overall performance, with tensile strength, yield strength, breaking strength, and elastic modulus being increased by 85.4 %, 58.4 %, 101 %, and 128 %, respectively. The composites developed in this research exhibit promising potential for applications within the electrical and electronics industries, showcasing their versatility and performance advantages in advanced material science.}
