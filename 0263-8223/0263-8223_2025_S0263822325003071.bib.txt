abstract = {This paper presents a mesoscopic unit cell structure that accounts for the differing properties of surface and inner cells in 3D braided composite materials. The structure is used to predict the dynamic response of a macroscopic model under high-speed ice impact, validated through experimental tests. Ice impact resistance tests were conducted on composite plates of varying thicknesses, analyzing displacement response and damage morphology under different impact speeds. The internal damage modes of the specimens were observed through CT scanning, revealing the ice impact resistance of plates with different thicknesses. A mesoscopic model, incorporating a viscoelastic resin constitutive model, was developed to simulate strain rate-dependent mechanical properties and applied to the macroscopic model. This approach accurately predicts the ice impact resistance of 3D braided composites, offering valuable insights for safety analysis and structural design of 3D braided composite structures in aviation.}
