abstract = {This study describes the use of continuous jute yarn fabrics innovatively manufactured through manual loom, followed by a hand lay-up process to obtain composite laminates with biobased castor oil and epoxy systems. A full factorial design (22) is employed to evaluate the effects of matrix phases (epoxy and castor oil polymers) and jute fibres (uni- and bidirectional fabrics) on the apparent density, porosity, tensile, three-point bending, and Charpy impact responses. The three-point bending behaviour is also predicted through numerical simulations using a finite element numerical analysis to validate the elastic behaviour of the laminates. The incorporation of castor oil matrix results in decreased density, tensile modulus, flexural strength, and flexural modulus, while simultaneously increasing the porosity and the impact resistance compared to the epoxy laminates. Additionally, unidirectional fabrics have lower porosity and enhanced mechanical properties in the longitudinal direction compared to bidirectional reinforcements. Overall, these composites appear to be sustainable and cost-effective alternatives for use within secondary structural design applications.}
