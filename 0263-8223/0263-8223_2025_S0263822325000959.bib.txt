abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical and numerical approach to investigate the buckle propagation phenomenon in sandwich pipeline under the external pressure based on the classical theory of shells. Assuming steady state buckle propagation, the components of the strain in the transition zone is derived from the available solutions of the displacement of the transition zone obtained in previous works by employing von Kármán’s nonlinear geometric relationship. The expression of the yield surface as well as the distributions of the plastic and elastic domains in the sandwich pipeline is educed by considering that the materials of the sandwich pipeline are incompressible and exhibit linear elastic linear hardening behavior. From the principle of conservation of energy, an explicit solution of the buckle propagation pressure for the sandwich pipeline under external pressure is established. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed analysis are justified by comparing the analytical solution of the buckle propagation pressure with the experimental results from the existing literatures and the numerical predictions from ABAQUS finite element analysis. It is found that the buckle propagation pressure increases with the increasing of the yield strength or the strain hardening modulus of the outer and inner face-sheet layers but is insensitive to the change of the Young’s modulus. The core layer is used to provide thermal insulation and to improve the bending stiffness of sandwich pipelines and can bear the external load only when its yield strength reaches 40% of the yield strength of the facesheet layer. Furthermore, the buckle propagation pressure of the sandwich pipeline decreases with the reducing of the total thickness-to-radius ratio. In particular, when the thickness-to-radius ratio is less than 10-3, the buckle will not propagate along the sandwich pipeline regardless of the magnitude of the external pressure.}
