abstract = {Nowadays, the design of composite structures become increasing more challenges. Various optimization techniques are continuously developed to identify the most effective configuration design. This paper presents an extended optimization technique for designing structures that incorporate multiple materials with tunable volume constraints. By doing so, the digital images and the standard tessellation language (STL) are employed as input data for 2D and 3D problems, respectively, with the aid of color-encoding to visually represent the material properties. The proposed approach combines the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) and bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) to effectively address the optimization problems. SBFEM is particularly noteworthy for its ability to overcome the hanging node issue by utilizing hierarchical mesh decomposition techniques such as quadtree and octree, while simultaneously minimizing memory requirements by pre-computing and storing master-element matrices that represent the element stiffness of cell patterns. Leveraging image processing techniques, specifically convolution filtering, facilitates the generation of a multi-level grid, enabling the adaptive mesh layout crucial to achieving optimal designs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through various numerical examples, showcasing its capabilities in delivering superior structural designs.}
