abstract = {The hybrid design principle, combining architectural components of traditional lattices, has been validated for polymeric lattices to enhance energy absorption performance. To ascertain its effectiveness for extensively studied metallic lattices, a hybrid structure fabricated by the Selective Laser Melting technique with stainless steel powders was investigated by quasi-static compression tests, to compare with its parental topologies – Octet and Rhombic Dodecahedron structures. The relatively high and stable post-yield stress level attained endows the novel design with both high energy absorption capacity and efficiency, strengthening its advantages against the two counterparts. More importantly, this confirms the universal veracity of the hybrid design principle in structural formulation, free from the constraint of base material selections. Although the base material anisotropy of additively manufactured lattices has always been neglected in previous studies, the stainless-steel lattices were compressed along the printing and transverse directions in this study, to identify the impact of angle-dependence of cell strut material properties. The disparate crushing modes of lattices under the two compression directions substantiate the anisotropy of global lattice responses, induced by the layer deposition solidification process. Only with the angle-dependent base material properties incorporated can finite element models simulate the experimental observations appropriately. Furthermore, diverse deformation patterns captured on different surfaces of a transversely compressed Octet lattice imply the intricacy of crushing modes for lattices under complex loading circumstances, whereby the record from a single perspective by merely one digital camera is insufficient.}
