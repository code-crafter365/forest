abstract = {Maxillofacial bone repair demands implants that match native mechanics, yet conventional designs struggle to balance strength and toughness. We present an interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) that couples a PLA lattice with a PETG network, printed via multimaterial FDM into P-type TPMS architectures with offset thickness d = 0.4–1.2 mm. The IPC shows a synergistic “1 + 1 > 2” effect: versus porous PLA, compressive strength increases by 153–244 %. Finite-element analysis reveals more uniform stress fields and delayed local buckling under compression. A modified dual-phase Gibson–Ashby model predicts elastic modulus and yield strength across densities and compositions, with good agreement to experiments. Calcein-AM/PI and CCK-8 assays indicate high cell viability and negligible cytotoxicity. ALP activity and Alizarin Red staining support preserved osteogenic potential, while short-term subcutaneous implantation demonstrates favorable tissue responses with neovascularization and collagen remodeling. Simulated body-fluid immersion shows composition-dependent, predictable hydrolytic behavior. Collectively, the rigid–flexible coupling of PLA/PETG IPC TPMS structures yields concurrent gains in strength, toughness, and energy absorption with reassuring biosafety, positioning this platform as a promising option for load-bearing, patient-specific craniofacial implants and offering a practical framework for performance prediction and design optimization.}
