abstract = {Nowadays, the investigation of the mechanical characteristics due to constrained torsion and bending and shearing of wide flange functionally graded material (FGM) box girders of variable thickness has become a world abstruse problem of structural mechanics of FGM. To surmount this insoluble problem, established is an (ordinary differential equations) ODEs-based analysis methodology by adopting the semi-analytical method in computational mechanics. By using this methodology, the warping strains of all cross-sections of a wide flange FGM box girder of variable thickness after constrained torsion will be expressed into a set of functions, and one mechanical analysis problem such as the constrained torsion of FGM beams will be transformed into a boundary value problem of a group of ODEs. The rationality and effectiveness of the methodology established are evaluated by the computational results of numerical examples, which reveal that when a wide flange FGM box girder of variable thickness is subjected to constrained torsion, the maximum warping stress on its cross-section due to a torque is greater than the maximum normal stress caused by a bending moment possessing the same amount of the torque.}
