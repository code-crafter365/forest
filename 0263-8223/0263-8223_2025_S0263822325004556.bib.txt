abstract = {Acoustic metamaterials depend on the geometry and spatial distribution of their microstructure, which is difficult to change without an external mechanical load after manufacturing, which limits their application in complex mechanical environments. Based on the sound insulation mechanism of traditional Helmholtz resonators, the resonant frequency of embedded tube Helmholtz resonators is theoretically deduced in this paper, and the regulatory relationship between the structural parameters and their acoustic characteristics (transmission loss) is derived. Then, using the shape memory effect of the shape memory polymers (SMPs), reconfigurable embedded tube Helmholtz resonators with various temporary configurations are designed. On this basis, reconfigurable metamaterial honeycomb sandwich panels with reconfigurable microstructures and adjustable macroacoustic performance are further constructed. Through simulations and experiments, the excellent sound insulation performance of reconfigurable metamaterial honeycomb sandwich panels in different configurations is verified. In addition, the sound insulation performance of honeycomb sandwich panels with the same arc length but different wave numbers and different bottom configurations is analysed in detail. This study plays an important role in guiding the application of acoustic metamaterials in complex mechanical environments.}
