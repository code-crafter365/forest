abstract = {The demand for lightweight, high-performance aerospace vehicles necessitates accurate analysis of thermal buckling in shell structures, which are prone to instability under some extreme working conditions, e.g., hypersonic flight in the air. This study adopts an isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell model with continuous rotational formulations to address limitations of traditional FEM, such as the large number of degrees of freedom required for accurate solutions, the geometric approximation errors introduced by mesh discretization, and the challenges associated with drilling rotation stabilization. Utilizing NURBS basis functions, the IGA framework ensures higher-order continuity and geometric precision with fewer degrees of freedom. The method is combined with the arc-length technique to robustly track nonlinear equilibrium paths, enabling accurate prediction of thermal post-buckling behaviors with snap phenomena. Numerical results for flat plates and curved shells validate efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, establishing it as a promising tool for the design of lightweight structures in thermal environment.}
