abstract = {Boron nitride (BN) nanomaterials are widely employed to enhance the physical properties of materials and are well-known in the design of composite structures. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to study the sintering dynamic characteristics and mechanical enhancement mechanism of nano-Cu/BN nanosheets composite structure. Based on pressure assisted sintering, the influence of sintering pressure, sintering temperature and other related parameters on the sintering performance of composite structures was compared. The role of BN nanosheets in the sintering process was revealed through characterization methods such as mean square displacement, sintering density, and atomic phase transition. The sintering performance of composite structures is related to the degree of atomic diffusion, while atomic motion depends on the surface wrinkles of BN nanosheets. Changing sintering parameters can regulate the phase transition and recrystallization process of composite structures. In addition, we have introduced a novel concept of “Enhanced Delayed Strain (EDST)” to describe the mechanical performance changes of composite structures during the tensile process. The range of EDST is determined by the deformation of BN nanosheets in the vertical tensile direction. The performance of composite structures in the mechanical reinforcement stage depends on the density of the sintered body and the number of stacked BN nanosheets. This study can provide theoretical guidance for the design and performance regulation of nano-Cu/BN nanosheets composite materials, and provide new insights for the field of chip sintering interconnection.}
