abstract = {Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) effectively facilitate the lightweight design and load-bearing capacity of metal tubes in weapon systems. Most studies focus on systems combining glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP), carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), and aluminum (Al), primarily under axial loading, while research on steel-based components under radial loading remains limited. This study explores the quasi-static radial mechanical response of carbon fiber-reinforced stainless steel tubes (CFR-SSTs) and optimizes their winding angles and layer numbers. Experimental results show that CFR-SSTs with 8 layers wound at 90° exhibit the best radial load-bearing performance: under tensile loading, their modulus and strength are 21.8% and 63.2% higher than those of stainless steel liners, respectively; under compressive loading, the modulus increases by 33.1%, and specific energy absorption improves by 37.5%. Finite element simulations show a nonlinear increase in radial load capacity with additional layers. Finally, considering both cost-effectiveness and radial tensile-compressive performance, CFR-SSTs with 24 layers wound at 90° are identified as the optimal radial load-bearing configuration. This study develops a layered optimization framework for radial load-bearing CFR-SSTs, offering practical guidelines to advanced lightweight, multifunctional steel-based composite weapon system.}
