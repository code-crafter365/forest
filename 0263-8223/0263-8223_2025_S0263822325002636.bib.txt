abstract = {The impact of diverse matrices on the microstructure and friction wear characteristics of WC matrix composites has been the subject of investigation. In this study, three types of WC matrix composites with different matrices compositions were prepared using the casting infiltration method. The matrices employed were high manganese steel, high chromium cast iron, and high carbon steel. The microstructure and phase composition of the WC steel composites with different matrices have been investigated using a range of analytical techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and field transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). This paper presents the findings of an investigation into the friction and wear properties of different matrices WC steel matrix composites. The high manganese steel sample is primarily composed of α-Fe, Fe3W3C, and Cr7C3, while the high chromium cast iron and high carbon steel specimen are predominantly constituted by α-Fe, Fe6W6C, and Cr7C3. The Fe6W6C phase formed in the high carbon steel sample exhibits both [1, 1, −1] and [-1,1–6] as the zone axis. The hardness, friction coefficient and wear rate of the high carbon steel samples were superior, with values of 751.13 HV, 0.60 and 10.31*10-5mm3/(N*m) respectively. Under identical conditions, the wear resistance is fourfold that of the high manganese steel sample and 70 % that of the high chromium cast iron sample. The superior wear resistance of the high carbon steel specimen is likely attributable to the distinctive shape and orientation of the Fe6W6C composite zone.}
