abstract = {A novel origami-based tunable acoustic metamaterials (OBTAM) has been designed, which employs Kresling origami as a Helmholtz resonator and integrates it with a sound-mass regulation strategy, for tunable, low frequency wideband, and lightweight sound-absorption. The single-degree-of-freedom (i.e., torsion angle) property of the Kresling origami structure is utilized to continuously tune the height of the resonance cavity by torsion. The transfer matrix method is applied to quantify the relationship between noise suppression and continuous adjustment. Furthermore, the sound-mass regulation strategy at the cavity neck is proposed, which shows that the single-hole concentrated mass mode is favorable to the lower frequency band while the multi-hole distributed mass mode is favorable to the higher frequency band with wider tunable bandwidth, the sound absorption mechanisms and boundary effects are further discussed. Combining the mass regulation modes and further optimizing the structural parameters improves the tunable bandwidth. This tunability of OBTAM is verified using simulations and experiments, which exhibit excellent broadband sound-absorption performance, with the lowest absorption frequency below 88 Hz, the adjustable bandwidth of 726 Hz, and the sample thickness is of only (1/62)λ. This work inspires the design of new sound-absorption metamaterials with lightweight, low-frequency, variable frequency bands, and especially intelligence control capability.}
