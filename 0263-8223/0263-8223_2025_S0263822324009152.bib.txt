abstract = {The stiffness degradation law is a key part of the simulation model to predict the fatigue behaviors of CFRPs. Traditional approaches to determine this law are time-consuming while with infrared radiation (IR) thermography, the stiffness degradation can be characterized by applying a rapid fatigue test, which takes a fairly short period. However, the stiffness degradation measured during rapid fatigue tests by thermography is under multiple stress levels and limited cycles. In this work, a stiffness degradation law determined by classic fatigue test, originally proposed for unidirectional CFRP laminates, has been extended to multi-directional laminates. Then, a strategy to establish the normalized stiffness degradation law has been developed based on rapid fatigue tests by thermography. The non-linear cumulative damage rule has been considered to analyze the damage condition at the beginning of each stress level during rapid fatigue test by thermography. Thus, the test time can be greatly reduced for the determination of this law which is necessary for the prediction of the fatigue life by numerical simulation. The numerical results of the fatigue life prediction for two kinds of multi-directional laminates using stiffness degradation law based on thermographic measurement correlate very well with those obtained from the measurements during classic fatigue tests.}
