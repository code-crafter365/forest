abstract = {The bi-continuous interpenetrating structure of ceramic reinforcement and Al matrix is expected to achieve a breakthrough in the trade-off between strength and toughness of Al-matrix composites. This study reports a promising method using biomimetic design and hybrid technology combining additive manufacturing with melt infiltration to prepare Al-matrix composites with high geometric freedom and superior mechanical properties. The Al2O3/Al interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) with BCC and Gyroid lattice-based ceramic scaffolds exhibit simultaneously enhanced compressive stress, energy absorption, and specific energy absorption. The highest gain in specific energy absorption of Al2O3/Al IPCs reveals an impressive sixfold increase. These significant improvements are attributed to damage delocalization, interfacial interactions, and geometric effects of ceramic lattices. Overall, this study provides a potential strategy for lightweight Al-matrix composites in automotive and aerospace applications.}
