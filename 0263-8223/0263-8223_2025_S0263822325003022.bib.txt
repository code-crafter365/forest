abstract = {The translaminar fracture of fiber-reinforced composites is vital in many applications, and can be influenced by hygrothermal environments in service. These effects are however not sufficiently well understood in the literature, especially the translaminar fracture mechanism of hygrothermal effects and its reversibility still need to be revealed. Thus, a systematic study of the hygrothermal and re-drying effects on the translaminar fracture toughness was carried out through compact tension tests, with the corresponding damage mechanisms investigated by the scanning electron microscope. The experimental results indicated a significant decrease in apparent stiffness with a minimal crack propagation after hygrothermal aging, while dried and re-dried specimens maintained stiffness and facilitated multiple stable crack propagations. In addition, the R-curves showed greater stability in dried and re-dried conditions compared to hygrothermal conditions, with normalized stable translaminar fracture toughness of 1.0, 1.68, and 1.5, respectively. Finally, the fracture surface analysis revealed distinctive toughening mechanisms under different conditions, highlighting significant fiber bundle pull-out under hygrothermal aging. In addition, the quantitative study of translaminar fracture toughness can serve as a basis for fiber failure criterion and provide model input for the simulation and evaluation of the effects of hygrothermal aging on CFRP performance.}
