abstract = {This study investigates the influence of size effects on the mechanical properties of heterogeneous architected metamaterials, focusing on three designs: the Reentrant Honeycomb Structure (ReHS), Derived Re-entrant Honeycomb Structure (D-ReHS), and their hybrid (H-ReHS). Through a multidisciplinary approach combining experimental testing, finite element analysis (FEA), and micropolar elasticity theory, we explore how structural size, represented by varying Representative Volume Element (RVE) orders from 2 × 2 to 20 × 20, affects specific stiffness and strength. Samples, fabricated, via stereolithography 3D printing, were tested under compression, with deformation captured using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The results show that the specific stiffness of ReHS and D-ReHS remains largely unaffected by RVE order, while H-ReHS exhibits a significant size-dependent increase, with a 6.7-fold improvement in stiffness at a 20 × 20 RVE order compared to 2 × 2. Additionally, H-ReHS shows enhanced load-bearing capacity, with a maximum load of 5.59 kN at 20 × 20, approximately 8.5 times greater than ReHS and 6.3 times greater than D-ReHS. Micropolar analysis reveals increased bending stiffness and uniform stress distribution in H-ReHS, confirming strong size effects. These findings highlight the potential of heterogeneous designs for achieving programmable mechanical properties in advanced material applications.}
