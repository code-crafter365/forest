abstract = {To resolve the conflicting requirements between high filler loading and mechanical degradation in highly thermally conductive polymer composites, this study proposes a novel fabrication strategy. Surface magnetization modification of micron-scale (1 µm, 10 µm) and nanoscale (100 nm) boron nitride (BN) particles through Fe3O4 nanoparticles was implemented to establish magnetically responsive filler systems, while epoxy resin (EP)-based composites were fabricated using external magnetic field orientation technique. Microstructural characterization demonstrated that paramagnetic mBN particles under a 50 mT magnetic field were aligned along the field direction to form three-dimensional interconnected network architectures, effectively forming continuous thermal conduction pathways. Furthermore, significant synergistic effects of multiscale fillers were demonstrated. When micro/nano mBN was blended at a 1:1 mass ratio (total filler loading: 25 wt%), the thermal conductivity of the composite reached 0.806 W/(m·K), representing a 229 % enhancement compared to EP. The potential of EP/mBN composites for thermal management applications was thereby indicated. Finite element simulations revealed the dynamics of filler alignment: during magnetic field orientation, smaller filler dimensions were found to correspond with reduced displacement, consequently increasing orientation velocity. This study provides a theoretical foundation for gradient structure design, and the development of epoxy resin-based thermal conductive composites suitable for electronics thermal management.}
