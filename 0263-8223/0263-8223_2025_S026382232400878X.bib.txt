abstract = {The significant amount of waste concrete generated during wars, earthquakes, building demolitions, and urban renewal projects can be processed into recycled aggregates, thus aiding environmental protection and promoting the sustainability of the construction industry. However, the complex mechanical properties of recycled concrete, such as its cracking behavior, considerably limits its application in structural engineering. In this study, a numerical theoretical model of real recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) was established to investigate its mechanical behavior and cracking mechanisms. The model accurately captured the internal crack evolution and stress–strain relationship variation in RAC under uniaxial compressive loading, accounting for the effects of the recycled aggregates, old mortar, interfacial transition zone, type of natural aggregates, and microporosity. The findings of this study can serve as a basis for elucidating RAC failure mechanisms and highlight the impact of recycled aggregates on structural concrete design.}
