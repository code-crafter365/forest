abstract = {This paper addresses reduced order homogenization of composites with strength difference (SD) effects in elastoplasticity coupled to damage, while containing several well-known plasticity criteria as special cases. We extend two approaches for this purpose: 1. nonuniform transformation field analysis (NTFA by Michel and Suquet, 2003) and 2. a recent variant called cluster-based NTFA (CNTFA by Ri et al., 2021), and conduct a comparative study on them. For the NTFA approach, a space–time decomposition is done separately for volumetric and deviatoric inelastic strain fields. A coupled model is derived for the present case to govern the evolution of resulting reduced variables. For the CNTFA approach, a clustering analysis is additionally performed for a spatial decomposition of the micro-domain. Unlike the NTFA, the online analysis is formulated as a unified minimization problem, which does not require a major adaptation for the present case. For both approaches, localization rules are deduced from the superposition principle and then homogenized to obtain the effective responses. FE-based implementation is presented in detail for both approaches. Numerical results show that both approaches provide a striking acceleration rate against conventional FE computations. The CNTFA predictions are more accurate than the NTFA ones by involving clustered microscopic fields in the online analysis, thus resulting into a slightly increased memory requirement.}
