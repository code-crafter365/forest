abstract = {Electronic skin can mimic the complex functions of human skin and has attracted significant attention from researchers in the fields of wearable electronics and multimodal perception. However, accurately recognizing multiple external stimuli using a single sensing component is a major challenge. In this study, we designed a flexible strain-temperature bimodal sensor that simulates the structure of human skin and lobster tail. The sensor has a sandwich-like structure and utilizes polydimethylsiloxane substrate-based multidimensional conductive network. The sensor benefits from the multidimensional conductive effect of the sensitive materials in its sensing layer, resulting in a high gauge factor of 7.668 (with an ultra-high linearity of 0.995), low strain detection limit (0.2 %), good repeatability within the strain range of 0 − 170 %. In addition, the sensor has a high resistance temperature coefficient of 5.139 (within a temperature range of 65 − 100 °C), well stability and reliability. Given the fine sensing performance of the strain/temperature sensor, it can not only recognize sign language movements based on machine learning, but also serve as an integral component of a smart temperature monitoring system. It has a bright application prospect in future wearable terminal and multimodal information perception and fusion.}
