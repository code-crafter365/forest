abstract = {The Mori-Tanaka method is well-known for its good predictive capabilities and excellent time efficiency. However, a significant weakness of the Mori-Tanaka method is its decreasing accuracy as the volume fraction of particles increases. Therefore, this paper focuses on developing a new approach to improve stiffness predictions for particle-reinforced composites across a wide range of particle volume fractions by using a mixed data-driven and mean-field homogenization modelling strategy. The basic idea is to modify the strain concentration tensor by fitting the results of Mori-Tanaka homogenization to data generated using numerical full-field homogenization based on the representative volume element (RVE). The modified tensor can then replace the original strain concentration tensor within the established framework of Mori-Tanaka homogenization to predict the effective stiffness. The results obtained using the proposed approach are in good agreement with those provided by full-field finite element-based homogenization. Moreover, the results obtained through Mori-Tanaka and double inclusion methods have been added for reference. The presented results demonstrate the potential of the proposed data-driven mean-field model as an efficient approach for addressing the micromechanics of particle-reinforced composites.}
