abstract = {Tiled laminates (TLs) are an innovative class of composite materials designed for applications in FRP bridges. To investigate their mechanical behaviour under tensile loading, an enhanced three-dimensional progressive damage model (3D PDM) incorporating out-of-plane stiffness degradation (both tensile and shear moduli) is developed and validated against experimental results. Based on this, a parametric analysis is conducted to systematically examine the effects of inclination angle, geometric configuration, layup arrangement, and out-of-plane stiffness degradation on the mechanical performance. The results indicate that increasing the inclination angle significantly reduces the ultimate load-bearing capacity and shifts the failure mode from intra-layer damage to inter-layer failure. Further, using an overlapping geometric configuration significantly improves the ultimate tensile strength. Moreover, ignoring out-of-plane stiffness degradation significantly overestimates the tensile load-carrying capacity. These findings demonstrate the reliability of the established model, and provide a scientific basis for the design optimisation and engineering application of TLs.}
