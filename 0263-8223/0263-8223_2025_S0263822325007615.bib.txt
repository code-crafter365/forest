abstract = {Here, the behaviors of transversely deformable auxetic viscoelastic multi-layer or sandwich composite plates exposed to low-velocity impact by spherical, flat-ended cylindrical, or conical indenters are investigated. The available articles on the impact analysis of the plates/shells have employed contact models consisting of either a Hertz-type half-space stiffness in series with the structure stiffness or a strain energy associated with a Hertz-type half-space contact model. The discussions made in the article prove that both of these approaches lead to conceptually wrong outcomes. Some of the critical novelties that are included here are: (i) proposing novel concepts for the development of nonlinear thickness-dependent contact models that consider the transverse mobility of the plate instead of utilizing the common half-space-based Hertz-type contact models, (ii) incorporation of the supports effects on the local contact stiffness, (iii) definition of the time-dependent viscoelasticity-inspired effective contact stiffness, (iv) considering the thickness-deformability of the plate in the framework of the zigzag sandwich plate theory, (v) considering of the indenter shape, (vi) extension of the models to orthotropic auxetic viscoelastic multi-layer/sandwich structures, (vii) proposing a technique for solving the resulting coupled nonlinear augmented integrodifferential finite element system of equations. The governing finite element equations are developed by using a principle of minimum total potential energy that incorporates the energies of the indentation and the bending-extension of the plate, the three-element Zener auxetic viscoelastic model, refined contact stiffnesses, and exact/analytical computation of the heredity integrals. The time histories are traced by a hybrid iterative Runge-Kutta and trapezoidal algorithm. Furthermore, while the contact force increases with the nose radius of the indenter, the lateral deflection and contact/rebound time grow for indenters with sharper noses. Moreover, the effect of the viscoelasticity on the contact and overall stiffening of the core is larger in the presence of auxeticity. While the presence of the viscoelastic core has increased the contact force up to about 30 %, the increase due to the auxetic viscoelastic core has reached about 85 %, depending on the indenter shape, for the employed data.}
