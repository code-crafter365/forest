abstract = {This paper introduces efficient single- and multi-objective optimization approaches for designing material and thickness variations in microscale in-plane functionally graded (IFG) variable-thickness thin-walled structures. The isogeometric multi-mesh design concept is employed to generate two distinct non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) meshes at different resolutions. The coarser mesh defines the microshell geometry and profiles of thickness and material volume fraction, with values at control points as design variables. A deep neural network (DNN)-based surrogate model of high-fidelity isogeometric analysis (IGA), built on a finer NURBS mesh combined with Mindlin’s strain gradient elasticity and Reissner–Mindlin shell theory, is integrated with the Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA) and its multi-objective variant (MOAHA). Numerical examples demonstrate the superior efficiency of DNN-AHA and DNN-MOAHA over the IGA simulation-driven counterpart and traditional optimization methods such as particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms. The influence of material, thickness, and strain-gradient parameters on optimal FG microsized structure designs is thoroughly examined.}
