abstract = {The primary objective of this research is to examine the sound transmission loss (STL) in a shallow sandwich cylindrical shell featuring a 3D auxetic honeycomb core. Initially, the 3D elasticity theory was employed by applying the state vector method and extracting both local and global transfer matrices to calculate STL relations for the cylindrical shell, including the auxetic honeycomb core. Subsequently, boundary conditions were applied to calculate the unknowns, eventually leading to a relationship for calculating STL within the structure. The derived equations were numerically solved using MATLAB software. The validity of the results obtained using this method was examined by comparing them with the findings of other researchers. Moreover, a comparison was conducted involving a large ratio of the curvature radius to thickness, considering both the auxetic honeycomb core and aluminum with equal mass. The results demonstrate a significant increase in STL when utilizing this auxetic honeycomb core compared to a material with the same mass. Specifically, at a frequency of 2 Hz, a significant enhancement of about 29.44 % in STL is observed when increasing the core thickness from 10.39 mm to 20.39 mm. Furthermore, STL results have been obtained for various thicknesses, radius of curvature, and incident angles.}
