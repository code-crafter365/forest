abstract = {With the increasing size of wind turbine blades, bend-twist coupling (BTC) technology has become a crucial method for naturally reducing stress, improving stability, and prolonging service life against fatigue. The BTC effect can be adjusted by modifying two key parameters: the fiber off-axis angle within the main spar and the spanwise position where the BTC effect begins. These modifications enable the blade to twist under bending loads, which subsequently reduces the angle of attack and diminishes the associated loads. To investigate the BTC effect on load reduction, an aeroelastic model combining Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory with Geometrically Exact Beam Theory (GEBT) is developed for the IEA 15 MW wind turbine blades. Under typical turbulent wind conditions, there is a notable enhancement in load reduction at the blade root as the fiber off-axis angle increases and the spanwise position moves towards the blade tip, albeit with a corresponding decrease in output power. Interestingly, introducing a negative pre-twist angle to the blade is found to partially compensate for the power loss and further decrease the root loads. This suggests that pre-twist, in conjunction with BTC, can be strategically utilized to optimize load distribution and enhance the overall performance of wind turbine blades.}
