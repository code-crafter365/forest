abstract = {High modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer (HM-CFRP) is widely employed in the aerospace industry due to its high strength and lightweight characteristics. However, enhancing the bonding strength of adhesive joints remains a challenge. To improve the adhesive strength of HM-CFRP, the present study introduced a UV picosecond laser ring-texturing technique and investigated its effectiveness and the underlying mechanisms of strength enhancement. The maximum shear strength was obtained at a laser power of 1.9 W, as the carbon fibers of the HM-CFRP could be exposed and maintained their integrity. An increase in hydrophilic functional groups on the HM-CFRP surface after laser treatment was observed by FTIR technique. By using appropriate geometric parameters of the ablation area, the surface hydrophilicity and the adhesive strength of HM-CFRP were improved. The difference in bonding strength between different textures was investigated. The result shows that the bonding strength of the circle-ring texture improved by 64 % (18.24 MPa to 29.91 MPa) improvement compared with the untreated ones. By analyzing the failure interfaces and performing a simulation analysis, the ring-texturing mechanism improved the boding strength by impeding crack propagation and reducing the peeling force.}
