abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) compression-dispersion model (CDM) for interfacial friction quantization and its effects on load-slip behavior of stud-UHPC connection are studied in the present paper. Firstly, an 3D CDM is proposed to quantify the positive effects of interfacial friction force on shear behavior of stud-UHPC connection. Then, a triple stage load-slip model is proposed for stud-UHPC connection considering the effects of interfacial friction force. The accuracy of the proposed models is verified by published data from push-out test. The advantages of the proposed 3D CDM for interfacial friction quantization are discussed and the effects of interface friction force on load-slip behavior of stud-UHPC connection are clarified. Results show that the proposed 3D CDM based model can predict accurately the distribution of interfacial friction stress in two directions while the 2D CDM based model can only reveal the distribution of the interfacial friction stress in one direction. Interfacial friction force increases about 12% of the shear stiffness, the yielding and the peak loads of stud-UHPC connection. The elastic stiffness of stud-UHPC connection increases with stud diameter, UHPC strength and interfacial friction force, which is most sensitive to stud diameter, followed by UHPC strength and interfacial friction force.}
