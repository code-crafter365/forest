abstract = {Cellular structures represent a promising lightweight, functional, structural material, but their application in large-scale space structures remains constrained by manufacturing limitations. To address the challenges of insufficient reconfigurability and programmability, a modular, reconfigurable cuboctahedron-based cellular metastructure design method is proposed. This design method incorporates the flexural rod-based structure to achieve programmable mechanical properties, and utilizes the cuboctahedron’s geometry to design modular, reconfigurable components. An equivalent mechanical model is established to analyse the influence of rod diameter on anisotropic mechanical properties of the cellular metastructure. Furthermore, a programmable cellular configuration network is constructed to facilitatethe inverse design of deformation-oriented cellular structures with customized mechanical performance. Experimental validations using 3D-printed prototypes demonstrate the cells’ reconfigurability and deformability. The proposed design method and achievement provide practical guidance for engineering applications of cellular structures.}
