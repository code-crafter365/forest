abstract = {Beam lattice metamaterials have attracted significant attention for their high stiffness-to-weight ratios and exceptional energy absorption capabilities. This paper introduced a novel class of body-centered cubic (BCC) beam lattices, which utilized I-beams with joint reinforcements fabricated through vat photopolymerization (VP). Quasi-static compression tests were performed to demonstrate the improved mechanical properties of the proposed lattices. Compared to the lattice made of circular cross-sectional beams, the specific modulus of the I-beam and reinforced I-beam lattices improved by 23% and 80%, respectively. The specific yield strength enhanced by 12% and 81%, respectively. Notably, the proposed lattices exhibit a two-stage energy dissipation mechanism, enhancing energy absorption by 230% and 247%, respectively. Additionally, experimentally validated finite element (FE) models were developed to study the effects of cross-sectional designs on the crushing behaviors of the lattices. The proposed beam lattices can be used as lightweight energy absorbers with highly customizable properties for various engineering applications.}
