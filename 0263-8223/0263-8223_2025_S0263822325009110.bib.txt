abstract = {The large deployable mesh reflector represents the state-of-the-art in the field of space deployable antennas; however, its performance is constrained by the pillowing effect, which degrades surface accuracy and limits the large-scale development of deployable mesh reflectors. In this study, a deployable high-strain composite laminated parabolic shell reflector configuration is proposed to mitigate the pillowing effect of existing large deployable mesh reflectors. Further, a dynamic theoretical model of the composite laminated parabolic shell is developed based on the first-order shear deformation shell theory and solved using the Rayleigh–Ritz method in combination with the orthogonal Chebyshev series method. A systematic parametric analysis is conducted, considering laminate design, material properties, and geometric parameters. A composite laminated thin-shell component is fabricated using T700/7901 UD fiber-reinforced composites through an autoclave forming process. A modal test system is designed, and modal tests are performed. The maximum deviation between experimental measurements, FEM simulations, and theoretical calculations is less than 4.81%, demonstrating excellent agreement. Although the proposed design shows significant potential for future space applications, the present study is limited to laboratory-scale validation; its performance under full-scale deployment and extreme space environments remains to be investigated in future work.}
