abstract = {This study explores the mechanical behavior of hybrid single-lap joints combining carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with aluminum alloys, emphasizing the influence of fiber stacking configurations and self-piercing riveting (SPR) techniques. Four self-piercing riveting (SPR) methods—regular (R-SPR), post-cured with prepreg (PC-SPR), pre-holed (PH-SPR), and pre-holed post-cured with prepreg (PHPC-SPR)—were evaluated under two stacking sequences: [0°/90°/0°/90°]s and [0°/90°/90°/90°]s. Lap-shear tensile test and failure mode analysis were conducted to assess joint quality, maximum load, stiffness, energy absorption, and residual strength. The experimental results show that the hybrid joint with prepreg as the adhesive layer is superior in stiffness and maximum load to the traditional R-SPR joint. In addition, the PHPC-SPR joint still retains a high residual strength after the adhesive layer fails. The PC-SPR and PHPC-SPR joints exhibited significant improvements over R-SPR, with maximum load increased by up to 86–144%, stiffness by 83–89%, and energy absorption by 17–43%. Mechanistically, the prepreg layer improved bonding and stress transfer, while the pre-drilled hole minimized fiber damage and enhanced interlocking, thus increasing residual strength. The reason is that the pre-drilled hole design of this joint effectively reduces damage to the carbon fiber layer and improves the rivet’s interlock. In terms of laminate configuration, the [0°/90°/0°/90°]s structure exhibits better energy absorption and load-bearing capacity than [0°/90°/90°/90°]s, confirming that the stacking sequence has a significant influence on joint performance. An important innovation in this study is the use of fixed-thickness carbon fiber prepreg as an adhesive to replace the traditional liquid adhesive. This method can more effectively apply glue to curved or uneven surfaces while precisely controlling the thickness of the adhesive layer, making it highly promising for composite structural bonding applications.}
