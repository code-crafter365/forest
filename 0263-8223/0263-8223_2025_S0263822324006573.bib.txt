abstract = {In this paper, a versatile compound strip method (CSM) with non-uniform spline functions is developed for buckling analysis of stiffened structures. The proposed method further extends the existing CSM by permitting the flexible modification of local knots to place the stiffeners along the strip arbitrarily. In addition, a reasonable knot arrangement can achieve an accurate solving procedure with improved convergence. The displacements of stiffeners are expressed compatibly by the fundamental parameters of skin according to the beam-plate model. Consequently, the reinforcement of stiffeners is naturally incorporated by adding the beam stiffness matrix to the corresponding strips. Based on the first-order shear deformation plate theory and non-uniform spline functions, the semi-analytical formulations of stiffened structures are established. The present method provides the possibility to achieve the local mesh refinement in the finite strip methods. The convergence and validation study is demonstrated through the comparisons with the results of the existing literature solution and finite element method. In conclusion, a more efficient and applicable CSM is proposed to analyze the buckling behaviors of stiffened structures.}
