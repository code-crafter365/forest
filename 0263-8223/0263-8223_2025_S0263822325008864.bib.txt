abstract = {The high power flux and frequent thermal surges in electronic devices pose significant challenges to the performance and reliability of thermal management materials. Conventional single phase change material (PCM) is inadequate for repeated thermal shock mitigation. Herein, a novel gradient phase change thermal management material (GPCTCM) strategy is proposed for the first time, which is realized through the fabrication of Multi-LM@MXene and cellulose microfibers (Multi-LM@MXene/CMF) composite film. The composite films are systematically characterized through experimental and numerical simulation methods. Results show that the films exhibit dual-phase change behavior at 12.5 °C and 61.0 °C, with a high latent heat of 29.7 J/g. They also demonstrate isotropic thermal conductivity of 9.47 W/m·K and outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of 70.0 dB. The incorporation of low-melting-point EGaIn into microvoids significantly enhances both thermal and electrical conductivity, enabling a temperature drop of up to about 30 °C in light emitting diode (LED) thermal manegment applications. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that heterogeneous interfaces promote interfacial polarization coupling, further improving EMI attenuation. Additionally, the structural support provided by CMF imparts a tensile strength of 7.3 MPa and markedly reduces liquid metal leakage. These findings confirm that the synergistic integration of multiple-phase-transition liquid metals can effectively enhance the thermal and electrical performance of composite materials. This work offers a new paradigm for the design and development of advanced thermal interface materials for high-performance electronic systems.}
