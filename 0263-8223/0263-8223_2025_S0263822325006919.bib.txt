abstract = {This study investigates the thermal post-buckling and vibration response of bi-directional carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced composite plates subjected to a temperature gradient. The CNT content varies axially according to a power-law distribution governed by a concentration parameter and distribution profile, and the effective material properties are evaluated using an extended rule-of-mixtures formulation. The plates are modeled as simply supported with immovable edges, and are subjected to in-plane compressive forces. Due to the functional gradation (FG) along both the axial and thickness directions, thermal loading causes the neutral axis to shift toward the cooler region. This eccentricity generates additional thermal moments that substantially influence the post-buckling response. Temperature distributions are obtained by solving the steady-state heat conduction equation. The results reveal that the CNT gradation profile plays a crucial role in shaping the thermal field. Uniform CNT distribution leads to linear temperature variation through the thickness, whereas FG-X and FG-O patterns induce logarithmic profiles. The post-buckling path is traced using the Riks arc-length method. Findings show that the FG-X pattern offers enhanced thermal and vibrational resistance for small non-dimensional displacements, but this advantage diminishes for larger displacements. Eccentricity effects are more pronounced under unidirectional gradation than for bidirectional gradation.}
