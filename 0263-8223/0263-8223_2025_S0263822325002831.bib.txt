abstract = {Carbon/Carbon(C/C) composites are increasingly applied in hot-end components of aero-engines due to superior high-temperature mechanical properties. However, C/C composites are susceptible to oxidation under high-temperature conditions, restricting the application of C/C composites. In this research, a three-dimensional diffusion oxidation kinetic model in the diffusion-controlled oxidation stage was established for C/C composites with an anti-oxidation coating based on mass transfer and diffusion theory. Subsequently, the relationship between oxidation amount and crack oxidation propagation depth with oxidation time was calculated. The oxidation damage of C/C composites in the atmosphere at 700 °C ∼900 °C was evaluated by weight loss analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experimentally. Compared with the oxidation kinetic model, the measured values of oxidation weight loss and oxidation depth were in good agreement with the prediction of the model with the maximal error of 7.55 % and 10.87 % respectively, verifying the reliability of the model. Additionally, the sensitivity of oxidation depth to oxidation duration, oxygen partial pressure (OPP) and coating thickness at different temperature are analyzed, aiming to provide a model to predict the oxidation degree and provide reliable recommendations for thermal protection and antioxidant design of C/C composites.}
