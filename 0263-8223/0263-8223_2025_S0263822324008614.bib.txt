abstract = {Here we discuss the behaviour of very thick composite plates considering electro-magneto-elastic coupling of various types using fully three-dimensional (3D) kinematics. Published research highlights a lack of studies on the 3D mechanics of smart composite plates that integrate both higher-order (flexoelectric/flexomagnetic) and lower-order (piezoelectric/piezomagnetic) multiple physical fields (electro-magneto-elastic). The common approach to achieving the targeted and desired mechanical behavior within such composites could involve using structural elements. This gap can potentially be addressed by amalgamating the term ∂/∂z with the 2D governing equations of plates. This expression indicates alterations in thickness, in which z is the coordinate dedicated to the thickness. The governing equations can be created by operating on the variational method which enables us to establish and settle the 3D bending equations of the bulk structure. The pointed-out equations have been influenced by the implementation of additional hypotheses, such as von Kármán’s strain and complicated 3D tensor relations. Inserting the term ∂/∂z into the mathematical model renders that the analytical solution techniques are unable to assist us in obtaining numerical results. Consequently, a semi-analytical solving method grounded on the polynomial phrases facilitates the acquisition of the required solution. This fully 3D bending study of very thick piezocomposite cube-like bulk structures (CBS) can be an original reference in the field of mechanics of intelligent plate-like structures.}
