abstract = {This paper applies the discrete macro-element method (DMEM) to validate a simplified modelling strategy for the nonlinear in-plane response of masonry panels strengthened by Fabric Reinforced Cementitious Matrix (FRCM) systems. Following the general DMEM strategy, the presence of continuous strengthening fibre-reinforced composite layers applied on the external faces of the masonry wall has been described using 1D nonlinear links simulating the tensile failure of the reinforcement and its shear-delamination from the masonry substrate. Specifically, the masonry element and the FRCM layers have been simulated considering an equivalent homogeneous continuum material, discretised using a regular mesh of elastic-shear-deformable discrete elements interacting along their rigid edges through nonlinear discrete interfaces. The numerical analyses were conducted using the OpenSees software platform by simulating the experimental diagonal compression tests available in the literature. The results of the analyses are presented in terms of stress–strain curves, failure mechanisms and stress contours. The comparisons with the experimental observations have evidenced the capability of the adopted simplified modelling strategy to accurately predict the nonlinear and ultimate behaviour of masonry panels strengthened by FRMC systems with a potential limited computational burden.}
