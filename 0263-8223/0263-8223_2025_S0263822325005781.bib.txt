abstract = {A new analytical model is developed for evaluating curvature, deflection, axial normal stress, and interfacial shear and normal stresses in a multi-layered structure with creep deformations under general thermomechanical loading. The structure consists of an arbitrary number of layers of dissimilar materials, which are perfectly bonded. The model is based on an extended version of the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory accounting for the effect of Poisson’s ratio and the Norton creep model. The new model can be applied to multi-layered structures composed of plane stress (narrow) or plane strain (wide) beams. These features are different from existing models. To demonstrate and validate the newly developed analytical model for multi-layer structures, two example problems – one for a two-layer structure and the other for a five-layer structure – are quantitatively analyzed by directly applying the new model. For the two-layer structure, the analytical expressions and numerical results given by the current model match well with those provided in an existing study. For the five-layer structure, the numerical results predicted by the new model agree well with those obtained from a finite element model constructed using COMSOL Multiphysics. These examples also demonstrate the capability of the new analytical model to predict the changes in displacement, strain, stress, and interfacial stress fields with time during a creep process.}
