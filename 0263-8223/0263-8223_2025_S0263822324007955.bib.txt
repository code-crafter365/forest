abstract = {A structural design methodology is proposed for an ultrathin, ultralight, and absorption-adjustable electromagnetic absorber. The proposed absorber (SFSL) consists of an absorbing layer with shortcut glass-coated amorphous magnetic fiber and a substrate layer with transmitting material. This absorber features a Salisbury-like screen structure and incorporates multiple loss mechanisms. By investigating the influence of fiber distribution, length, content, and substrate layer thickness on absorption performance, it has been determined that the weight per square meter and thickness of a single-layer SFSL can be lowered within 50 g/m2 and 1.5 mm respectively. Furthermore, the absorption intensity and bandwidth can be adjusted by manipulating these parameters. The SFSL exhibits resonant behavior similar to that of a metamaterial absorber; however, SFSL with randomly distributed fibers demonstrates broader and stronger absorption characteristics in the frequency range from 2 to18 GHz. Additionally, the thicknesses of the substrate layer and surface covering affect the electromagnetic response characteristics. This work provides a simple strategy for constructing an ultrathin and ultralight composite to achieve efficient absorption of electromagnetic waves.}
