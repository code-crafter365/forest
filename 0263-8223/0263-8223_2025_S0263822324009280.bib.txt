abstract = {Buckling and flutter characteristics of porous plates with graphene platelet (GPL) reinforcement subjected to concentrated edge loads are explored for the first time. The plate is considered to be having simultaneous variation of GPL and porosity content through the thickness. For the porous plate with GPL reinforcement, the effective material properties are determined using the Halpin–Tsai micromechanical model. Further, to obtain the solutions the Galerkin method is employed for the governing differential equations derived using Hamilton’s principle. The results of the present model are validated for accuracy and reliability by comparing them with the results available in the open literature for buckling, free vibration, and flutter studies. To study the flutter behaviour of plates under the effect of different types of concentrated edge loads, several parametric studies are performed for the first time. Additionally, the influence of GPL weight percentage, amount of porosity, dispersion of porosity, and GPL on the flutter instability is investigated. The results indicate that the type of concentrated edge load has a major impact on the flutter instability of the plate with centrally distributed (case 1) type of loading leading to a higher reduction in flutter pressure. Further, an increase in porosity and GPL content significantly affects the flutter and buckling coefficient values.}
