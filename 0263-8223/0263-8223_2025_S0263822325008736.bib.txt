abstract = {X-ray computed microtomography (mCT) results, using the high fluxes from a synchrotron source in conjunction with a novel application of digital volume correlation (DVC) is used to study the damage initiation mechanisms in laminated cross-ply composites. This imaging and analysis framework enables to capture 3D deformation within material volumes with high spatial resolution at macroscopic to submicroscopic scales. We present novel high-resolution experimental measurements that show the sequence by which damage is initiated in a notched composite and how damage progresses under quasi-static loading and cyclic loading conditions. These experimental results serve to develop multi-scale modeling methods that provide deformation response and fatigue life estimates accurately. Damage mechanisms and measurements at these length scales are scarce in the literature.}
