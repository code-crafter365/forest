abstract = {This study presents a high-temperature Corrugated-core Radar-Absorbing Sandwich Composite (CRASC) with stable electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption at temperatures up to 300 °C. The corrugated-core design facilitates broadband radar absorption and stable performance despite thermal fluctuations, achieving the goal of thermal insulation performance of the designed Thermal Gradient Insulation Multilayer (TGIM). Electromagnetic simulations analyzed the effect of variations in electromagnetic properties on the radar-absorbing capability of the structure. Based on these analyses, a radar-absorbing structure incorporating two corrugated cores was designed, and fabricated using an autoclave and a hot press. The − 10 dB bandwidth of the fabricated CRASC at room temperature was confirmed to be 5.8 to 17.2 GHz. The radar-absorbing performance of the fabricated specimens was evaluated in a furnace, with temperatures ranging from room temperature to 300 °C. These results confirmed that the − 10 dB bandwidth remained stable despite temperature variations while maintaining the wide absorption bandwidth and thermal insulation.}
