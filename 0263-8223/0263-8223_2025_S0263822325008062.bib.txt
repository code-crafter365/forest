abstract = {This study utilizes finite element analysis and data-driven models to predict the response of shape-memory zirconia metal–matrix composites. Zirconia is a shape-memory ceramic known for its unique properties such as superelasticity and shape-memory effect. In this study, first, we simulate the mechanical and shape-memory responses of microstructural representations of a zirconia-reinforced copper-matrix composite using finite element analysis. The simulation results are validated against experimental macroscopic stress–strain response of the composite as well as the evolution of the martensite volume fraction. Next, we employ two data-driven deep learning frameworks, a fully convolutional framework (FCF) based on the U-Net architecture, and CompINet, which combines convolutional and graph neural networks, to predict the martensite volume fraction within zirconia-reinforced composite microstructures. Training data are generated using the validated finite element framework. We evaluate and compare the performance of FCF and CompINet in estimating the martensite volume fraction in zirconia-reinforcing particles. Both DL models demonstrate high accuracy, exceeding 96%, in predicting martensite volume fractions within zirconia particles. This work introduces fast and accurate predictive frameworks that efficiently model the mechanical behavior of shape-memory composites, helping to speed up their design process for various applications.}
