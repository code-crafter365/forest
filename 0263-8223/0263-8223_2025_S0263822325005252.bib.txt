abstract = {The importance of lightning strike monitoring (LSM) for aircraft composite structures has been progressively recognized. However, due to the drastic damage process and harsh electromagnetic environment of lightning strikes, LSM, especially the fundamental but critical task of lightning attachment-point localization remains a challenge. A guided wave-based LSM method of composite structures is presented to overcome the challenge. In the method, the lightning strike-induced guided wave responses, capable of long-distance propagation through struck composites even under the strict electromagnetic condition, are online collected with in-situ piezoelectric (PZT) wafers and then applied to image the attachment points over the monitored structures. After the direct effects of lightning strikes on composites are analyzed, the piezoelectric online sensing of guided wave responses with PZT wafers is explored, during which the electromagnetic protection and short-circuiting preservation are particularly considered to deal with the extreme lightning strike condition. Furthermore, associated with the delay-and-sum algorithm, the guided wave imaging method of lightning strike events is developed for attachment point localization on composite structures. Finally, the efficiency of guided wave online sensing and imaging of lightning strike events is fully verified by the artificial lightning strike tests on the typical anisotropic carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite plates.}
