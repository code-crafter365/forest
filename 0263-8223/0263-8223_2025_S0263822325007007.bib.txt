abstract = {A new physically based fibre kinking model is proposed in this work to simulate longitudinal compressive failure in composites. The overall continuum is enriched kinematically, which allows for differentiation between the deformations of the kink band and the surrounding bulk region during loading. Separate material models are used for these two regions of the continuum, and an effective overall Cauchy stress is returned based on the Hill-Mandel macro-homogeneity condition. Detailed physics associated with kink banding can be predicted, such as shear-instability due to matrix nonlinearity, large fibre rotation and post-collapse plateau stress. The formulation explicitly accounts for the kink band width, thus making the response mesh-objective. A user-friendly implementation in Abaqus/Explicit is provided. This two-scale framework is first validated against explicitly modelled two-element compression test case, and then with experimental results on axial compressive failure from a wrinkle defect embedded in a multidirectional laminate, showing very good agreement of load–displacement history and damage pattern.}
