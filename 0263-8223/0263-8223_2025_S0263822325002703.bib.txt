abstract = {This paper investigates the shear behavior of a novel steel-UHPFRC composite beam under different failure modes, with emphasis on the distinct roles of each component in resisting shear forces, highlighting their interaction and relative performance. Three composite beams were designed to introduce different failure modes and experimentally tested, their fracture behavior was analyzed using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques to capture strain localization, microcrack initiation and propagation. The beam B1 with failure mode by yielding of steel dowel exhibited high shear-resistance capacity and a ductile fracture process. The beam B2 with failure mode by UHPFRC splitting showed premature failure of UHPFRC at the interaction zone, and B3 with UHPFRC web failure exhibited the weakest performance due to premature failure of UHPFRC web. The shear resistance of each beam was calculated using an analytical method based on the failure mode, which aligned well with the experimental results, providing further validation of the approach. This study emphasizes the need for optimized shear reinforcement in the UHPFRC web and enhanced detailing at the interaction zone to maximize composite action. Additionally, design recommendations for practical application were provided.}
