abstract = {The measurement of elastic constants in unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) laminate is crucial for ensuring the desired material properties and for monitoring degradation during service. This study proposes a novel solution to the inverse problem of determining the elastic stiffness matrix. In contrast with the conventional methodology that entails the extraction and classification of individual wave modes, the proposed method employs a more comprehensive strategy that utilizes overall time-of-flight (TOF) image matching between predicted data and recorded data. Based on the principles of wave propagation theory, the TOF inversion technique is proposed for the development of a prediction-based TOF template. Subsequently, the elastic stiffness matrix is reconstructed by aligning the predicted template with the collected experimental data through a template matching process. Simulations were conducted to validate the reliability of the proposed method and to evaluate the selection of the template. The experimental results agreed well with data obtained from immersion tests, which are widely accepted as a reliable measurement technique. Furthermore, the proposed method enables the reconstruction of the elastic constants using only the specimen’s thickness information. This work presents a promising in situ approach with less manual intervention and straightforward determination of all elastic constants.}
