abstract = {A methodology combining Hill–Mandel lemma and asymptotic homogenization is applied to obtain closed-form analytical formulas for the higher-order effective stiffness coefficients of locally periodic plane laminates which behave as strain gradient homogeneous media at the macroscale. Such laminates can have periodic cells with any finite number of perfectly bonded layers. The formulas are applied to the particular case of a generic two-phase sandwich-type cell with isotropic constituents and arbitrary layer thicknesses. The effective coefficients preserve the usual symmetry properties. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the behavior of the effective higher-order coefficients as a function of the periodic cell. Proportionality relations were found between the fifth-rank effective coefficients as well as between some of the sixth-rank effective coefficients. Similarities and differences with results obtained by other methodologies are discussed. The closed-form analytical formulas obtained for the effective coefficients could be useful for controlling numerical codes in more complex periodic cells.}
