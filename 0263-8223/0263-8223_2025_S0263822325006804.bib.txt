abstract = {The aim of the paper is the development of a finite bending analysis of hyperelastic prismatic beams made of functionally graded soft materials. The Mooney–Rivlin constitutive laws for rubber-like mediums are modified to introduce a spatial variation of the mechanical properties. For this purpose, different through-the-thickness relations are defined to characterize the material distributions of the soft constituents. Therefore, the expression of the stored energy function is modified accordingly. The beam model is three-dimensional and fully nonlinear. The analyses are carried out analytically, and include the evaluation of the anticlastic radius of curvature. The theoretical framework is general, and is presented in both Lagrangian and Eulerian reference systems to compute the Piola–Kirchhoff and Cauchy stress components, respectively. Several applications are presented to discuss the influence of the mechanical configuration on the structural response. The validity of the proposed formulation is verified through the computation of the equilibrium equations within the beam cross-section, checking the extent of any deviation from their expected null values.}
