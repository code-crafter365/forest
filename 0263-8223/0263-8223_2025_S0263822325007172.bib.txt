abstract = {To simultaneously satisfy multiple performance objectives, including lightweight, low-frequency bandgap, and high-frequency vibration suppression, this study proposes a nonlinear isolation metastructure bio-inspired by an overall configuration of frogs, which is fabricated via 3D printing with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials. The bio-inspired unit cell features asymmetric softening stiffness and piecewise restoring force behavior. By stacking these unit cells, a bio-inspired tandem metastructure is constructed. The proposed design enables effective isolation of low-frequency vibrations and suppression of high-frequency vibrations. Results from theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate its superior mechanical performance because of the designed adjustable and nonlinear mechanical characteristics. To address practical requirements for broadband vibration suppression, three key performance objectives, total mass, initial isolation frequency, and high-frequency attenuation, are optimized through a multi-objective Pareto strategy. Experimental tests on multiple prototypes confirm the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed design and optimization algorithm. The prototype designed with optimal parameters exhibits excellent dynamic performance under complex operating conditions, highlighting strong potential applications in vibration isolation, suppression, and noise reduction.}
