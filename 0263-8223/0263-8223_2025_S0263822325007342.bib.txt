abstract = {The formability of Ni/Al composites in hot forming–reactive synthesis process for NiAl components remains insufficiently studied. In this study, Ni/Al interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) sheets were fabricated via vacuum hot-press sintering of Ni nets and Al foils at 500–600 °C. The sheet prepared consists of an Al matrix, a Ni net reinforcement phase, and a brittle interface composed of NiAl3 columnar grains and Ni2Al3 ultrafine equiaxed grains. Higher sintering temperatures increase the brittle layer thickness (4.29–26.8 μm), reducing ductility. The sheets exhibit strong anisotropy due to the Ni net structure. Under 45° tension, the combined effect of Ni net distortion and Al plasticity significantly enhances elongation, reaching over 110 % at 600 °C—more than twice that in the 0° direction. At elevated temperatures, Al softening facilitates interfacial separation and Ni net deformation, while room-temperature fracture is governed by crack propagation along the brittle layer. The optimal processing window for Ni/Al IPC sheets is determined to be a sintering temperature of 500–550 °C and a deformation temperature of 600 °C. These results provide a basis for forming optimization and application of Ni/Al IPCs in NiAl alloy component manufacturing.}
