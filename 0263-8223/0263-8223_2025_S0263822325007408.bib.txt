abstract = {Composite materials are widely used in the aerospace field due to their excellent mechanical properties and are often fastened with bolts because of manufacturing constraints. In this paper, a parametric Finite Element Method (FEM) model of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composite laminates with single-bolt single-lap joints is developed and experimentally validated. The model is then integrated with the Sobol method, using a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) as a surrogate model, to perform a sensitivity analysis of eight structural parameters affecting joint stiffness. The analysis yields the first-order sensitivities, total sensitivities, and parameter coupling effects. The results indicate that the stiffness in each slip phase is primarily influenced by the friction coefficient and bolt preload. Additionally, the friction coefficient exhibits strong coupling with structural parameters such as ply thickness and the ratio of width to bolt hole diameter. The sensitivity characteristics of the equivalent stiffness are associated with those of the nonslip and macroslip phases, with the nonslip phase playing a dominant role. The second-order sensitivity reveals a greater number of coupled parameters, though with weaker coupling intensity.}
