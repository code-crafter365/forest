abstract = {Strain-hardening cementitious composites, also known as high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composites, display exceptional strength and toughness not only under static conditions but also under high-speed dynamic loading. The mechanical properties of these composites are greatly influenced by the orientation and dispersion of embedded fibers. However, experimental analysis of complex fiber arrangements in real specimens has limitations, necessitating the development of computational models to understand the impact of fiber distribution. This study examines the effect of fiber distribution conditions on composite behavior using a Voronoi-Cell-Lattice-Model that incorporates reinforcing effects into discrete-type quasi-brittle matrix elements. Firstly, virtual fiber distribution models revealed that as the gauge length of specimens increased, weaknesses in fiber distribution were more likely to form, leading to decreased strength and strain capacity. Secondly, the model demonstrated that favorable fiber orientation relative to the loading direction and minimal sectional deviation in fiber dispersion significantly increased strain capacity and toughness. Finally, the study explored the wall-effect that may arise during specimen fabrication due to the boundary of the casting mold.}
