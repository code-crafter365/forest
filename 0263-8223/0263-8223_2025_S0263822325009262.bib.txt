abstract = {This paper proposes a programmable meta-sandwich panel with active control capability and investigates its vibro-acoustic characteristics under single-point harmonic excitation from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. First, a theoretical model describing the vibro-acoustic behavior of the meta-sandwich panel is developed based on the first-order shear deformation theory, the energy method, the modal superposition method and Hamilton’s principle. The resonance and sound pressure responses are then derived using the Duhamel and Rayleigh integral method. Subsequently, a custom experimental setup is employed to measure the vibro-acoustic performance of the meta-sandwich panel, and the experimental results are used to validate the proposed theoretical model and its predictions. Finally, the established model is used to explore the effects of key parameters on the vibro-acoustic behavior of the meta-sandwich panel.}
