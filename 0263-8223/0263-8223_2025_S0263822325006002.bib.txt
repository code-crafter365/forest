abstract = {The advent of two-dimensional (2D) materials has accelerated the development of functional electronic devices, particularly stretchable and wearable devices. Among emerging 2D materials, borophene, an allotrope of boron, has attracted considerable interest because of its remarkable mechanical, electrical, and piezoresistive qualities. Despite its use in many applications, borophene is yet to be used in strain sensors. This study adopted a liquid exfoliation method consisting of wet-grinding-assisted ultrasonication and demonstrated its effectiveness in obtaining ultrathin borophene nanosheets. These exfoliated borophene nanosheets were used to fabricate a nanocomposite with one-dimensional (1D) silver nanowires (AgNWs) as a sensing layer sandwiched between two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers to fabricate a tensile strain sensor. This unique nanocomposite of 2D and 1D nanomaterials demonstrated outstanding strain-dependent resistive behaviour, with a gauge factor of 5.17 at 10 % strain, rising exponentially to approximately 90 at 40 % strain. The sensor exhibited excellent recovery and repeatability, confirming its reliability under cyclic loading. The borophene-AgNWs nanocomposite exhibited sensitivity to temperature variations as well suggesting potential use in wearable sensors where strain and temperature sensitivity are crucial. Eventually, the strain sensor was utilized for wearable technology by integrating it into a sleeve and subjected to repetitive wrist movements to monitor the symptoms of lateral epicondylitis.}
