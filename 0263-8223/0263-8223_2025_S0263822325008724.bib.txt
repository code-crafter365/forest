abstract = {Composites consisting of fiber and matrix are naturally heterogeneous materials and the fiber–matrix interfacial behavior is extremely important to their performance. This work presents a novel mechanisms-based investigation on non-uniform curing process and fiber–matrix interfacial behavior via self-sensing fibers. Upgraded experimental study was conducted to investigate the multi-field coupling mechanisms of non-uniform curing process and the influence on matrix −fiber interfacial behavior. The complex non-uniform multi-fields coupling curing process was characterized by thermal-chemical and physical–mechanical interactive models and implemented in the finite element analysis. Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the evolution of non-uniform temperature and degree of cure fields as well as the strain transfer mechanism between matrix and self-sensing FBG fibers. The simulation results indicated that the conventional matrix-fiber interface model widely used for composite laminates can lead to significant errors compared to experimental results. Therefore, a new mechanisms-based matrix-fiber cohesive-tie interfacial model is proposed, and the simulation results successfully predicted the non-uniform multi-field coupling mechanisms.}
