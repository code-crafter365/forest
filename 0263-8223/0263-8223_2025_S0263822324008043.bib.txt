abstract = {This paper studied the effect of different fibres and their architectures on the low-velocity impact (LVI) and quasi-static compression after impact (CAI) characteristics of textile fibre-based structural composite materials (TFSCM) manufactured using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) method. All specimens were tested at three distinct impact energy levels: 20 J, 30 J, and 40 J. Subsequently, optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), and 3D X-ray micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) techniques were utilized to examine and analyze the internal and external damage morphologies, failure mechanisms, and damage distribution within the structural composites. The experimental findings revealed that the basalt epoxy-based three-dimensional (3D) woven fabric-reinforced composites had superior energy absorption and deformation resistance than the glass and sisal-based unidirectional (UD) and bidirectional (2D) composites across all impact energy levels. Furthermore, µ-CT analysis showed that specimens impacted at 40 J experienced a 128.41 % and 154.36 % increase in damage volume compared to those impacted at 30 J and 20 J, leading to complete perforation damage and z-yarn bending and breakage without any delamination at the impact site. More importantly, composites reinforced with UD preforms impacted at 10 J exhibited higher CAI strength compared to both 2D and 3D composites.}
