abstract = {Thermosetting resins play a pivotal role in the aerospace sectors, developing a model that can quickly and accurately assess the damage behavior of resins under temperature conditions particularly important. In this work, a data-driven surrogate model capable of accurately capturing the thermal-damage behavior of thermosetting resins is proposed. Firstly, a method for extracting material damage data from stress-strain data is proposed, leading to the construction of a material failure database. Subsequently, A deep neural network optimization model based on K-fold cross-validation is proposed to learn from the constructed database, and 3D data is generated by using a finite element batch calculation method, resulting in the creation of 1D to 3D thermal-damage evolution surrogate model for thermosetting resins. Further, using the user-defined Umat subroutine in Abaqus software, the corresponding numerical model and computational procedure are developed. Finally, a representative volume element for the typical EC230R resin and its UD-composites is established, and numerical simulations are conducted under different temperature environments. Comparisons with experimental data show that the simulation curves closely match the experimental curves, with an average prediction error in mechanical properties within 5%, demonstrating the high precision of the proposed model in capturing the thermal-damage behavior of thermosetting resins. It is evident that the proposed model can significantly enhance the efficiency of developing advanced composite structures, and it offers a novel approach for the development of thermal-damage evolution models for other isotropic materials.}
