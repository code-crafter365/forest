abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates are widely used in aerospace structures. However, variations in geometry and processes may induce excessive assembly stresses in laminates, which can lead to damage. Thus, timely detection of assembly stress in laminates is crucial. Conventional stress detection devices are unable to measure the assembly stresses around the holes in laminates both accurately and non-destructively. To address this limitation, this paper proposed a deep learning model—SSTAS-GAN (Surface Strain Transforms to Assembly Stress – Generative Adversarial Networks)—which integrated architectures such as cGAN and U-Net. By learning from a database of physical fields calculated via finite element analysis, the model transformed surface strain fields into assembly stress fields in laminates. For predicting assembly stresses around the holes in laminate-aluminum alloy joints, SSTAS-GAN significantly outperformed traditional CNN and U-Net models. Within the Region of Interest (ROI), the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) increased from 0.8207 and 0.8185 to 0.8868, and the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the edge maps rose from 0.1675 and 0.0721 to 0.3071. By constructing this assembly stress prediction network, the assembly stress during the laminate assembly process was effectively predicted, thereby providing a novel perspective and a robust technical approach for evaluating the quality of composite assemblies.}
