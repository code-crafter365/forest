abstract = {Wire-arc-based directed energy deposition (DED) has enabled the onsite fabrication of large-scale metallic components. Low carbon steels are one of the common materials used for large-scale structures. However, to strengthen the low carbon steel, an appropriate heat treatment method is required, which is challenging to adapt for large-scale components. An alternative approach to improve strength is to reinforce the steel with stronger materials. This work presents a hybrid manufacturing approach (additive + subtractive) to realize continuous fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites. Wire-arc-based DED was adopted to deposit metal matrix followed by a subtractive method to create grooves for accurate placement of continuous fibers for the fabrication of each layer. The method was successfully implemented for the fabrication of a low carbon steel composite reinforced with 1.2 mm tungsten fibers and was tested under different loading conditions. Tensile and compressive yield strengths are improved by 151 % and 264 %, respectively. The flexural load resistance is improved by 152 % and the fracture toughness is increased by 153 %. The developed metal matrix composite shields gamma radiation with 40 % more effectiveness. Hence, fabricated composites may find potential applications as structural members in defense and nuclear industries.}
