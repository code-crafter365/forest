abstract = {This paper presents comprehensive experimental testing and numerical modelling of the failure behaviours of unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced polymer (UD-CFRP) composite laminae under multiaxial loading conditions. A novel modified Arcan test rig with a rotational clamp was developed to enable multiple stress combinations with out-of-plane stresses in UD laminae on a traditional laboratory-based uniaxial test machine. The test rig was verified by uniaxial tension and validated by off-axis tension. UD CFRP laminae were tested for the first time under five stress combinations using the test rig, with results cross-validated against a high-fidelity representative volume element (RVE)-based 3D micromechanical finite element model. Failure strength envelope and damage mechanisms demonstrate the applicability of the test rig for composite failure under multiaxial loading conditions with a broad spectrum of stress combinations.}
