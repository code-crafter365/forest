abstract = {This paper systematically presents the dynamical evolution analysis and vibration control method of laminated composite joined conical-cylindrical-conical shells (JCCCS) influenced by thermal environment and arbitrary boundaries through theoretical investigation and experimental validation. A series of hypothetical elastic springs operating on the edges of each shell are introduced to simulate the arbitrary boundaries and coupling connects. The dynamic evolution analysis of the laminated composite JCCCS is undertaken with the Rayleigh-Ritz approach. The results obtained by the proposed method show strong consistency with those reported in previous references, the maximum relative error between the calculated results and those from the finite element method (FEM) is less than 0.5%. The distinctive vibration characteristics of the laminated composite JCCCS subjected to variable temperature, arbitrary boundaries conditions and coupling connects stiffness are thoroughly exhibited. Furthermore, to implement vibration control functions of the laminated composite JCCCS, the NiTiNoL-steel wire ropes (NiTi-STs) are applied as a vibration damper. The dynamic vibration control of the laminated composite JCCCS with NiTi-STs in thermal environment has been investigated in frame of Lagrange equation and harmonic balance method (HBM). The vibration control capability and optimization schemes of NiTi-STs are explored by means of theoretical and experimental analysis.}
