abstract = {In this paper, a flexible honeycomb (FH) was designed and made, which can be freely bent to spherical surface and has better deforming ability than traditional hexagonal and over-stretched honeycombs. Combined with the deformable features of twill woven carbon fiber reinforced plastic fabrics, hemispherical sandwich shells were designed and made without wrinkles. Changes of the woven structure of twill fabrics and the FH cellular structure on the hemispherical shell were well predicted. Crushing behaviors of the hemispherical sandwich shells were tested. The deformation process can be divided into four stages: the flattening stage, the axisymmetric sag stage, the non-axisymmetric sag stage and the bottoming stage. Initially, the apex of the shell is flattened and then presents a quadrilateral depression. With the generation of four cracks, the deformation presents a non-axisymmetric depression, and the apex reaches the bottom when ε=0.5. The experiments reveal that the FH-core sandwich effectively improves the bearing capacity and energy absorption of the hemispherical shell. The FH not only has large deformation capacity, but also has bearing ability.}
