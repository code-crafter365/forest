abstract = {Advanced composites are integral to sustainable engineering applications like tidal turbine blades, lightweight aircraft panels, hydrogen storage vessels etc. However, these composites are susceptible to degradation from heat and moisture exposure during operation. This study aims to comprehend the degraded properties and long-term response of these composites using micromechanical framework. While the deteriorated mechanical properties of resin under hygrothermal conditions are quantified using a simplified empirical model, the Mori-Tanaka micromechanics approach evaluates the effective degraded properties of fibre-reinforced composites for different fibre volume fractions under moisture concentration. Further, a higher order kinematics is utilized to calculate the response of such composite plates under hygrothermal and mechanical loading. A finite element (FE) based numerical model is adopted for solution of the governing equations. Present micromechanical framework is able to predict the degraded material properties with sufficient accuracy. The overall response of the composite plates under hygrothermal loads is found in agreement with the existing works. Degradation analysis unveils the evolving mechanical properties over time, providing vital insights into the long-term performance of composite materials.}
