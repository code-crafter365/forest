abstract = {Current lattice structures lack twist characteristics and remain insufficiently studied under large deformations, limiting their potential in advanced engineering, particularly mode conversion. Inspired by the chiral double-helix of DNA, we propose a configuration integrating spatial helical chirality with body-centered cubic (BCC) topology, creating a new class of three-dimensional chiral lattices. This study focuses on the four-helix-chiral hybrid (FHC-BCC) unit cell, examining its large-deformation mechanical response via quasi-static compression experiments and finite element simulations. Specimens were fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM) and tested on a universal testing machine. Parametric analysis shows the hybrid configuration sustains stable twisting, enhances energy absorption, and maintains parallel ligament orientation during deformation. Increasing strut diameter d raises relative density, improves energy dissipation, and enables linear modulation of twist evolution, while increasing layer number N augments densification strain and refines compression-twist coupling for programmable twist control. These results highlight the role of geometric-topological synergy in tuning mechanical performance and broaden the design space for multifunctional metamaterials. The proposed architecture provides a viable route to high-performance, functionally integrated lattice systems with tunable mode conversion capability.}
