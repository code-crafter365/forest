abstract = {A multiscale analysis method based on the generalized finite element method (GFEM) is applied to capture localized damage in ceramic matrix composites (CMC). An enriched approximation is used, which allows the majority of the analysis domain to use coarse approximations with homogenized linear elastic material models. Local analysis is introduced on the fly to incorporate nonlinear, heterogeneous material behavior via the scale bridging GFEM with global–local enrichment functions (GFEMgl). A locally defined and globally inherited damage model is used to capture nucleation and progression of localized matrix microcracks in CMC structures. The GFEMgl is compared against a widely adopted multiscale method and demonstrated to be accurate, flexible, and efficient.}
