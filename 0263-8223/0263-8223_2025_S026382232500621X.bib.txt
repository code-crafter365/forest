abstract = {This paper predicts the effective elastic properties of short fiber reinforced composites with imperfect interfaces by the Finite Element (FE) homogenization method. The imperfect interfaces between the fibers and matrix are modeled as thin interphases. A Representative Volume Element (RVE) consisting of the fibers, matrix and interphases, is constructed by the modified Random Sequential Absorption (RSA) algorithm. The simulation results validate that the interphase model combined with the FE homogenization approach, can reliably assess the effective elastic properties of short fiber reinforced composites with imperfect interfaces. Meanwhile, the interphase model can accurately approximate the Linear Spring Model (LSM) and Interface Stress Model (ISM), respectively, in a specific range of the elastic modulus ratio. The influence of the interphase Poisson’s ratio on the overall elastic properties of composites is neglectable. Furthermore, the influence of the interphase elastic modulus and shear modulus on the effective elastic properties of composites becomes more pronounced as the interphase thickens from 50 nm to 500 nm. This paper provides a straightforward and practical method for predicting the effective elastic properties of short fiber reinforced composites with imperfect interfaces.}
