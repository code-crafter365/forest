abstract = {First shear horizontal (SH0) waves are crucial for ultrasonic guided wave-based health monitoring in thin plates due to their non-dispersive nature. However, the strong reflected echoes from plate boundaries severely interfere with the identification of damage features. This paper proposes a thickness gradient resin structure based on the principle of parameter gradient changes to control boundary echoes. Numerical simulation results show that the structure can significantly reduce the amplitude of boundary echoes, with a maximum attenuation coefficient of 0.908. By developing a composite plate model of thickness-gradient resin and steel, the dispersion characteristics and wave structure of SH waves are analyzed. Combined with numerical propagation analysis, this paper reveals that the structure suppresses boundary echoes through dispersion effects and wave mode conversion mechanisms. Experimental verification shows that, compared to damping clay, the proposed structure achieves a 40% improvement in boundary echo attenuation coefficient. This research provides an innovative solution for suppressing boundary echoes in thin plate structural health monitoring and has significant engineering application value.}
