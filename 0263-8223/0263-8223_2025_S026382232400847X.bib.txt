abstract = {As the speed of transportation vehicles such as high-speed train continues to increase, there has been a significant rise in both noise and vibration levels, substantially compromising passenger comfort and overall travel experience. In transportation vehicles, the necessity for transparency in windows poses a challenge in incorporating high sound-insulating or vibration-damping materials, rendering windows vulnerable in sound isolation and vibration attenuation. This study employs an integrated material-structural design concept to develop a multifunctional meta-window, which ensures optimal lighting transmission while achieving outstanding sound-insulating and vibration-damping capabilities. Two distinct structures, named ultra-lightweight thin plate-type metamaterial and high-stability thick plate-type metamaterial, are precisely designed to adapt to varied application scenarios. Utilizing a gradient parameter multi-cell parallel synergetic coupling design method broadens the working bandwidth for sound insulation. The meta-window incorporates localized resonance units, enabling acoustic and vibrational energy dissipation through low-frequency resonance, effectively enhancing the window’s sound-insulating and vibration-damping capabilities. Comprising a composite of various transparent materials, the design amalgamates sound insulation, vibration reduction, and light transmission, eliminating the need for opaque sound-insulating or damping materials. Consequently, it holds substantial potential for applications across sectors, including train, aircraft, and architectural domains.}
