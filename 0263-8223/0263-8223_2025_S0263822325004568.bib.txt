abstract = {This paper presents a novel multiscale modelling strategy for the early stage design of novel composite components. It includes the use of a global-local simulation approach followed by training a physics guided artificial neural network to predict composite failure indices from global-level loads. As a proof of concept, a non-conventional wingbox using the Z-Beam concept, capable of providing tailored bend-twist coupling for aeroelastic tailoring is analysed. The process begins by the application of strain-based global loads on a fully parametrised Z-Beam wingbox, after which, a structural detail of interest is analysed using a global-local approach and an evolved LaRC05 composite failure criterion. A database is created based on the repetition of the previous steps and is used to train a physics guided artificial neural network. At the end, it is observed that the proposed methodology is able to accurately predict composite failure based on global loads and design variables in a swift manner, proving itself as a valuable asset for the early design stages of novel composite concepts.}
