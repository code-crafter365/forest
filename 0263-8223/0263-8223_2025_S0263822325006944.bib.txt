abstract = {Composite pressure vessels are widely used for the storage and transportation of high-pressure gases/liquids while the composite winding layers are key structures that provide high strength and corrosion resistance. The filament winding process, including winding angle and layer thickness, significantly influences the pressure-bearing capacity of CPVs. However, variations in manufacturing processes often result in unknown composite layer structures, complicating mechanical analysis and defect detection.This study presents an adaptive full-focusing method to characterize CPVs composite layers. By deriving the elastic matrix in cylindrical coordinates and calculating QP-wave velocities for various winding angles using the Christoffel equation, the method integrates anisotropic velocity imaging with the Total Focusing Method (TFM). K-means cluster and edge-based active contour model enables adaptive contour extraction and image region segmentation, with cross-correlation analysis of actual CPVs contours used to match winding angles in each layer. Experimental validation on composite samples demonstrates that the method accurately reflects actual winding angles, with layered TFM imaging effectively capturing the contours and thickness of the composite structure.This research provides a robust characterization approach for CPVs composite layers, offering essential prior information for mechanical analysis and structural integrity assessments, with significant implications for reliability evaluation and quality control.}
