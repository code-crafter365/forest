abstract = {Stress concentration at the hole edges and inter-hole interference effects are the main factors affecting the mechanical properties of open-hole GLARE laminates. In this paper, a combination of experimental and numerical simulation is used to investigate the effects of the distance between two holes’ edge and fiber orientation on the tensile mechanical properties and failure mechanism of the GLARE laminate with two interacting holes. The strain field at the surface of the GLARE laminate with two interacting holes and the damage progression inside the laminate is monitored in real-time using a combination of digital image correlation and acoustic emission techniques. PCA and K-means++ algorithms are used to evaluate the tensile damage patterns and damage evolution of GLARE laminates. A 3D finite element model with Hashin failure criterion and cohesive zone model is used to predict the tensile behavior of GLARE laminates, and finally, the hole-edge stresses and inter-hole interference behavior were analyzed based on the stress concentration factor. The results show that the distance between the two holes’ edges decreases, the stress interference becomes the main cause of the laminate failure, while the stress concentration becomes the main cause as the distance between the two holes’ edges increases. The stress concentration factor at the edge of the two holes has a higher sensitivity to the direction of fiber orientation compared to the distance between the two interacting holes, which increases significantly with increasing fiber orientation angle.}
