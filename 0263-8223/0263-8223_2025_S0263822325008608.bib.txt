abstract = {Conventional mechanical actuators are limited in aerospace and adaptive architecture applications due to their high complexity and cost. Morphing structures, with their superior adaptability and morphing capabilities, have attracted increasing attention. In this study, a novel thermally responsive bistable structure is developed by introducing a segmented design and hybrid variable stiffness layers into the antisymmetric laminate. The effects of commonly used metal materials, hybrid layer width, and metal layer thickness on the stable configurations, snap behavior, and actuation characteristics of the bistable laminate are systematically investigated. Experimental and numerical results indicate that the incorporation of segmented variable stiffness layers significantly enhances the structural bistable characteristics. Furthermore, by leveraging the potential energy difference between stable configurations and the edge effects of the laminate, a combination of adaptive and active control is achieved. This study offers promising implications for advancing bistable structures in engineering applications.}
