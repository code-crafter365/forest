abstract = {This work presents a novel approach to parametric Model Order Reduction for fiber-reinforced laminated composites using First-order Shear Deformation Theory. Hierarchical Proper Orthogonal Decomposition creates local reduced bases for varying layer counts and fiber orientations. To interpolate between these POD subspaces of unequal dimensions, Schubert Variety-inspired Grassmann interpolation with Inverse Distance Weighting is employed. Adaptive grid sampling, incorporating physics-informed and Riemannian distance-driven methods, optimizes accuracy-cost tradeoffs. The methodology is validated through the multi-objective optimization of a C-cut composite plate, achieving significant computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. This work highlights advancements in parametric Model Order Reduction for composite structures, with applications in material design and structural analysis.}
