abstract = {In this paper, the temperature effects on the mechanical properties and damage mechanisms of plain-woven composites are investigated using AE technique, particularly distinguishing behavior below and above the glass transition temperature (Tg). Tensile experiments of plain-woven composites are conducted at temperatures ranging from room temperature to above the Tg. According to the cluster validity of AE signals and SEM observations, the matrix cracking, interface debonding and fiber breakage are identified as the three dominant damage modes. Especially, the peak frequency shifts of matrix-dominated damage modes above Tg are innovatively clarified. In the two temperature ranges divided by Tg, the damage mechanisms exhibit different trends with temperature variation. At T < Tg, matrix cracking occurs earlier with increasing temperature, but it is delayed at T > Tg. In contrast to matrix cracking, interface debonding presents a completely opposite trend, indicating that the interface properties are enhanced and then weakened as the temperature rises. By combining AE energy, counts, and events, a new concept of damage contribution proportion (DCP) is introduced to quantitatively compare the damage contributions of different damage modes. This study could provide useful guidance for the AE-based aerospace structural health monitoring of plain-woven composites at elevated temperatures.}
