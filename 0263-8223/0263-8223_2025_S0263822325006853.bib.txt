abstract = {It is a significant challenge that the accurate evaluation of internal damage in multidirectional carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates can be achieved via the ultrasonic phased array techniques due to their anisotropy and layered structure. The inherent characteristics of composite materials hinder rapid damage imaging, leading to increased computational complexity and time for acoustic ray path calculations. In this work, a batch synthetic aperture-multiple focalization (BSA-MF) method is proposed for the multidirectional CFRP laminates. The optimal number of activated array elements for the synthetic small aperture is determined based on the –6 dB divergence angle of the transducer, ensuring the inclusion of elements that receive damage-scattered signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio. By constructing an anisotropic and heterogeneous acoustic model, a single image can be obtained using a synthetic small aperture, with Dijkstra’s algorithm employed to calculate the acoustic ray path. And ultrasonic imaging of multiple delamination in multidirectional CFRP laminates can be achieved by superimposing the images obtained from each sub-aperture. Employing the BSA-MF method, numerical and experimental research on delamination imaging was conducted. A comparison of imaging quality and calculation time between the BSA-MF method and total focusing method shows that the proposed method has higher lateral resolution, and this method exhibits significant reduction with a factor of 51 for 2D imaging in computation time. Consequently, with the increase of detection area, 3D imaging efficiency can be significantly improved.}
