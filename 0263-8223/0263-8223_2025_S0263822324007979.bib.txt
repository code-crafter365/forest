abstract = {The acoustic topological waveguide (ATW) hosting topologically protected waveguide modes provides a unique opportunity for achieving large-scale sound transport with robustness. However, prevailing ATWs are typically designed by forward-designed sonic crystals (SCs) based on physical intuitions, unavoidably leading to restricted bandwidths. Here, using the inverse-designed SCs with maximized topological bandgaps, we construct broadband ATWs based on both the quantum spin Hall effect and the quantum valley Hall effect. Broadband large-scale transportation, spin-locked one-way transportation, and the squeezing effect of acoustic waves are demonstrated. This study ushers a new path for designing topological devices with broadband performance for large-scale acoustic wave transportation.}
