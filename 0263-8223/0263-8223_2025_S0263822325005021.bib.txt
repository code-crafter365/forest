abstract = {Current machine learning methods for identifying acoustic emission (AE) signals often fail to fully account for the underlying physical fatigue damage mechanisms in composite laminates, limiting the depth of understanding of damage behaviors. To address this limitation, this work proposes a novel machine learning approach guided by physical mechanisms for identifying fatigue damage in composite laminates using AE signals. The approach leverages the fact that early-stage damage in composite laminates is predominantly driven by matrix cracking. Initially, matrix damage modes are identified using AE signals from the early damage stages. These identified signals are then used to construct the base dataset for a semi-supervised deep neural network, which subsequently classifies additional damage modes. Clustering analyses are applied to assist the classification of later AE signal that are not explicitly categorized. This procedure iterates to each successive damage stage until the final failure of the laminates. The proposed method was applied on open-hole composite laminate subjected tensile fatigue load, including glass fiber reinforced polymer laminates and carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates. Comparisons with K-means clustering and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-K-means clustering methods indicate that the proposed approach provides new perspectives and more explanatory solutions for damage identification in composites.}
