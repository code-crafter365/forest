abstract = {The use of graphene-coated sand is an innovative approach for fabricating multifunctional cement composites, offering improved electrical conductivity with reduced filler consumption. However, existing coating technologies have high costs and complex processes, and theoretical research is still insufficient, which restricts their optimization and further development in engineering applications. This study presents an efficient coating technology based on PVDF emulsion and develops a multiscale predictive model combines finite element analysis (FEA), Mori-Tanaka (MT) method and effective medium theory (EMT) to evaluate the electrical conductivity of the porous graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)-coated sand-reinforced cement composites (GCSRCCs). Experimental validation confirms the model’s accuracy and reveals that when the electrical conductivity of the coating on the sand surface is below 0.1 S/m, the electrical conductivity of GCSRCCs becomes highly sensitive to the electrical conductivity of the coating. Compared with using GNPs directly as electrically conductive nanofillers, the strategy of coated sand achieves an electrical conductivity of up to 10−3 S/m and significant piezoresistive effects (with fractional change in resistivity >2 %) while reducing the use of GNPs by approximately 70 %. This study demonstrates that the GNPs-coated sand approach is a cost-effective and scalable solution for engineering applications requiring electrically conductive properties and low-cost for smart cement composites.}
