abstract = {Modular construction offers economic and environmental advantages over conventional construction technologies. Although several researchers have introduced various modular construction systems, the methods for creating channel structures within block modules and injecting epoxy resin to connect blocks efficiently have not been fully explored. This study proposes a new assembly channel system for modular construction using 3D printing. Four different channel types are fabricated using 3D printing, and epoxy resin is injected for block connections. The relationships between channel geometries and structural resistance are thoroughly analyzed with the uniaxial tensile and three-point bending tests. Both experiments are also numerically simulated using the finite element method to validate the modeling methodology for assembly channel systems. The validated methodology is useful for evaluating assembly channel systems and enhancing the design of such systems. Overall, this study can foster the practical application of modularization across various industrial fields.}
