abstract = {Because of its respective advantages, such as high load-bearing capacity relative to their bulk, low embodied carbon and renewable properties, and sustainability, wood is becoming more popular in engineering structures. Due to several effects, some deterioration occurs in wood structures over time, and the load-bearing elements lose their properties, especially the beam-to-column joints. This study investigates the mechanical behaviors of basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) glulam beam-to-column joints. Beam-to-column connections are realized using three methods and are wrapped 2, 3, and 4-times. Cycle loading load–displacement experiments are performed on beam-to-column joints. Vital mechanical behaviors, including maximum load-carrying capacity, energy consumption capacity, and stiffness value, are investigated. The data obtained from the experimental study are estimated by creating a model with artificial neural networks (ANNs) and finite element (FE) analysis. The obtained findings show that the effect of reinforcement improves the rigidities, energy consumption capabilities, and load-carrying capacities of beam-to-column joints. In addition, it is observed that the load-carrying capacity of beam-to-column joints increases with the increase in the number of plies. Furthermore, it is determined that the mechanical behaviors of the beam-to-columns strengthened with CFRPs are better than those for BFRPs.}
