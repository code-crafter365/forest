abstract = {In this paper, a novel honeycomb structure filled with waterbomb origami is proposed to enhance the mechanical performances of re-entrant honeycomb structure. The waterbomb origami structure plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical performance of the origami filled composite structure. Therefore, the compressive behaviors of the waterbomb origami structure are systematically investigated by theoretical analysis, simulation and experiment. The multi-objective optimization is performed on the waterbomb origami structure to obtain the optimal configuration. Subsequently, the deformation modes and energy absorption of the traditional re-entrant honeycomb and origami filled composite structures are researched. The simulation and experimental results indicate that origami filled composite structure exhibit higher specific energy absorption and better structural stability than re-entrant honeycomb. And the force–displacement curves, energy absorption and deformation modes of the composite structure can be adjusted by using various programmable patterns. In addition, the dynamic impact responses of the composite structure with different programmable patterns is investigated. The results show the composite structure exhibit excellent buffering protection and energy absorption. And the composite structure can be tailored to absorb various impact energy by using different programmable patterns. This works provide valuable references for the development of energy-absorbing and cushioning structures.}
