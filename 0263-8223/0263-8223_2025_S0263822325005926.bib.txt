abstract = {Composite materials are increasingly used in industries like aerospace and automotive, serving as critical structural components. Understanding the behaviour of these materials throughout their life-cycle is crucial. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems have been developed to address this need, aiming to detect, locate, and quantify damage while estimating the remaining life of the structure in real-time. These systems employ various techniques tailored to the potential damage that may occur in laminated structures. In this study, vibrational techniques, specifically modal analysis, were used to detect delamination damage in a Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) structure. Modal analysis involves obtaining the Frequency Response Functions (FRF) of the structure, which describe its behaviour under specific excitation frequencies. This response depends on the geometry, stiffness, and damping of the structure, with damage altering these parameters, thus it can be possible to detect damage. Composite beams investigated in the present work had delamination in two different positions with three different sizes. Three laminate configurations ([(0)12]T, [(0/45/90/0)3]T, and [(0/45/30/−45)3]T) were analysed. Computational analysis was performed by creating a finite element model with free-free boundary conditions to simulate laboratory testing. Amplitude and phase parameters were identified from the FRFs to be used in damage and statistical indices. All indices were analysed in terms of the damage imposed in the composite beams, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each index for damage detection and the influence of delamination on the structure’s behaviour. Both types of indices effectively quantified damage, but the literature damage indices demonstrated a more stable and superior response in terms of sensitivity compared to the statistical ones. Additionally, laminate symmetry emerged as a significant factor; indices returned consistent values even when delamination position changed. In contrast, when symmetry was absent, the indices varied in terms of the delamination position. Based on the analysis of the indices, a Design of Experiments (DoE) analysis was applied to the geometry to gain further insights into the influence of delamination. To enhance the efficiency of both types of indices, a filter for lower values from the FRF was applied. This refinement ensured that the indices considered only points near the modal frequency, representing the critical range affected by the frequency shift caused by damage.}
