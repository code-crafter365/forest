abstract = {To meet the demand for lightweight and high-strength materials in engineering applications, this research draws inspiration from the microscopic support structure of the beetle’s elytra. A novel hourglass-shaped lattice (HSL), based on biomimetic principles, was designed by extracting and transforming the hollow strut features of the beetle’s elytra. Nylon PA2200 was chosen as the matrix material for the specimen, which was fabricated using additive manufacturing and then subjected to a quasi-static compression test. The experimental results showed that the standard HSL structure (HSL-2S) possessing two connecting rods had a maximum increase in elastic modulus by 54.89 %, yield strength by 128.99 %, and compressive strength by 218.08 % as compared to the Circle, Square, and Square-incline thin-walled structures. Additionally, this research provided an in-depth analysis of the influence of design parameters, including the number of rods and the thickness of the shell, on structural performance using the method of controlled variables. The results showed that a reasonable arrangement of rods most effectively improves the mechanical performance of the structure. The research findings offered valuable design references for the development of lattice structures with excellent mechanical properties and efficient energy absorption.}
