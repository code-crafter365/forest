abstract = {Aerospace laminated composite structures often require thickness variations along one or more directions in order to satisfy weight and aerodynamic efficiency requirements. Thickness variation is achieved by introducing dropped plies at appropriate locations. However, the influence mechanism of the ply drop location has not been adequately elucidated. In this work, the effect of ply drop location on the mechanical properties of tapered laminates has been investigated by experiment and simulation. Three different ply-drop configurations of tapered laminates were subjected to quasi-static tensile tests. The main failure modes are delamination and ply damage. Delamination can significantly reduce the load-bearing capacity of the structure. The simulation results are in good agreement with the test results in terms of failure load, load–displacement response, and delamination regions. The results demonstrate that the ply drop location affects the order of occurrence of the main failure modes of tapered laminates and the propagation path of ply damage cracks, thereby influencing their mechanical properties.}
