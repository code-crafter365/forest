abstract = {Sandwich structures are usually used in aerospace and automotive engineering fields. By selecting different core materials and panels, a large number of design strategies are proposed to obtain various types of sandwich structures for various applications. Here, we developed a kind of shape memory sandwich structure using shape memory foam and laminates. The sandwich structure can not only program its shape utilizing SME but also can adjust its mechanical properties by controlling its temperature or shape. The mechanical and thermal–mechanical properties of shape memory laminates, foam and sandwich structure were characterized, respectively. The energy absorption property and bending resistance of the shape memory sandwich structure after being programmed were studied by compression test and drop weight impact test. Shape programmable and mechanical properties adjustable suggest potential applications of this sandwich structure in an adjustable shock-absorbing interface and space deployable structure.}
