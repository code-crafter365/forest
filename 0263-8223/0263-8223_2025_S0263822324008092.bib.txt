abstract = {The interlaminar shear strength and failure modes of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites at different temperatures ranged from 90 K to 353 K were thoroughly investigated by the short beam shear tests. Considering the three different lay-up configurations, i.e., unidirectional, cross-ply and angle-ply, the results showed that the interlaminar shear strength of the unidirectional laminates increased by 67.5 % with the decrease of temperature from room temperature down to 90 K, while they were insignificantly affected by cryogenic temperature for both the cross-ply and angle-ply laminates. A numerical model of short beam shear behavior was developed to calculate the interlaminar shear strength, and the results were found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, the observations of fracture surfaces using a scanning electron microscope provided the insights into the failure modes of the laminates at the microscopic scale. At 90 K the delamination in the unidirectional laminates was obvious, extending toward to the edge of the specimen. In the cross-ply laminates, a few large penetrating cracks appeared in the mid-plane, several small matrix cracks and voids were obvious in the fracture surface of the specimen. Additionally, the multiple cracks formed by the delamination were observed in the angle-ply laminates.}
