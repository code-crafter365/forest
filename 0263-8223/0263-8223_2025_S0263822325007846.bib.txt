abstract = {Fiber reinforced composite microstructures can be often complex, with irregular fiber arrangements, which brings the need for a generation mechanism so that said arrangements can be modeled and analyzed. Starting from an image of the actual microstructure, this work presents a method for generating statistically equivalent realizations of it through a simulated annealing-based statistical reconstruction algorithm for point patterns. This approach, in addition to being flexible and able to capture various aspects of the fiber arrangement, could produce realistic microstructures of considerable quality for finite element microscale simulations.}
