abstract = {This study proposes a high-fidelity numerical analysis method that considers both fiber-dominated and matrix-dominated damage to predict the influence of in-plane fiber waviness on the surface of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) laminates on their mechanical properties. Fiber waviness, a typical manufacturing defect in CFRTP, degrades the mechanical properties and complicates the damage behavior. Even under longitudinal loading, inhomogeneous multi-axial stresses develop around the in-plane fiber waviness, leading to splitting, which is classified as a matrix-dominated damage mode. However, the mechanism underlying the damage propagation has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, the fiber- and matrix-dominated damage modes were modeled separately, enabling a more detailed and comprehensive progressive damage analysis considering the interaction of each damage mode up to the final fracture. The proposed method was validated by comparing the results of the compressive and tensile strength analysis with the experimental data. Furthermore, the effects of fiber waviness on the damage mechanisms were investigated. Fiber-dominated damage was predominant when the severity of the fiber waviness was low, whereas matrix-dominated damage became more significant as the severity of the fiber waviness increased.}
