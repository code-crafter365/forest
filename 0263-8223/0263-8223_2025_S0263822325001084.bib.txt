abstract = {The rapid advancement of modern transportation systems has spurred a huge demand for low cost, lightweight, and high reliability composite materials, primarily owing to their high specific strength, design flexibility, and superior resistance to corrosion and high temperature, which makes them ideal alternatives to traditional metallic structures. Our work presents a thorough state-of-art review of the recent research and development progress of composite materials primarily in aerospace, rail transit, and automotive industries. Before addressing the application progress, some representative failure criteria have been introduced, providing the understanding and reference to the damage identification and fatigue life prediction. Despite significant advantages, the widespread integration of composite structures into modern transportation systems presents both a substantial challenge and a promising opportunity. Particularly, the structural integrity issues of composite structures have received more and more attention in engineering applications and assessment approaches, mainly in connection with failure constitutive laws, manufacturing considerations, extreme service conditions, structural health monitoring, repair and recycling, etc. An overview of the development of advanced composites within transportation systems is therefore provided, serving a reference for scientists and engineers.}
