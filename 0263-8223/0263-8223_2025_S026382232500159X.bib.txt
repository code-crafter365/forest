abstract = {In this study, free vibrations and buckling analyses of cylindrical sandwich shells with an auxetic honeycomb core and shape memory alloy (SMA) wires reinforced face sheets in thermal environments were conducted. The properties of the shape memory alloy wires were calculated using the one-dimensional Brinson model. The equations of motion were derived based on classical theory, considering Von-Karman geometric nonlinearity and utilizing Hamilton’s principle. The linearized and homogenized equations of motion, obtained through the perturbation technique, were solved using the differential quadrature method to determine the structure’s natural frequency and buckling load. The results were validated by comparing them with existing literature. The effects of the geometrical parameters of the structure, the volume fraction and pre-strain of the wires, and temperature on the natural frequency, buckling load, and thermal buckling were investigated. The results showed that by embedding honeycomb cells or wires in the circumferential direction of the cylinder, high natural frequencies can be achieved, while embedding them in the longitudinal direction creates high buckling load and thermal buckling. Additionally, increasing the pre-strain and volume fraction of the wires enhances the natural frequency, buckling load, and thermal buckling.}
