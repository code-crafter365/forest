abstract = {This paper studies the propagation characteristics of elastic waves through a sandwich structure with fiber reinforced composite laminates as core, with a focus on calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients. Firstly, the elastic constants of unidirectional lamina in the global coordinate system are obtained. The expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the sandwich structure immersed in water are derived using the transfer matrix method and interface bonding conditions. Three types of coupled elastic waves exist in the laminate, and their interactions result in the complicated reflection and transmission behavior. The effects of incident angle, fiber volume fraction, ply angle of fiber, and stacking sequence of laminates on the reflection and transmission coefficients are analyzed. In addition, the viscoelastic effect of the resin matrix is equivalent to the viscoelastic interface, and the influences of fractional Kelvin viscoelastic interface on the reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient, and dissipated energy ratio are also analyzed. It is found that the desired reflection and transmission behavior can be carried out by the optimal design of these parameters. This has strong theoretical and practical significance for the flexible design of sound insulation and noise reduction of sandwich structure with the fiber-reinforced laminates as core.}
