abstract = {Phase change material (PCM) uses latent heat to store heat and are widely used in thermal management of electronic components. However, endowing PCM with high thermal conductivity and high enthalpy remains a challenge. This study designs a multilayered structure, paraffin (PA)/styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene triblock copolymer (SEBS) (PA/SEBS) and PA/SEBS/expanded graphite (EG) (PA/SEBS/EG) are prepared by melt blending and crosslinked together in sequence, named 0EG@6EG. The results show that the enthalpy value of 0EG@6EG is as high as 167.46 kJ·kg−1, and the thermal conductivity has been improved compared to traditional uniform structure. 0EG@6EG has a certain degree of self-healing ability, and the contact surface between layers could withstand a tensile strength of 0.23 MPa. The passive experiment indicates that the temperature rising rate of 0EG@6EG is 4.08 % higher than that of PA/SEBS/3EG. The active experiment shows that the highest outlet temperature difference between 0EG@6EG and PA/SEBS/3EG is 1.52 °C, and the heat released is 26.73 % higher than that of PA/SEBS/3EG. The optimal thickness ratio between PA/SEBS/0EG to PA/SEBS/6EG in 0EG@6EG is 1.2:0.8, and when the active system contacts with the layer of PA/SEBS/6EG, it is conducive to enhance heat transfer. This work provides a reference for increasing the thermal conductivity of PCM without decreasing enthalpy value.}
