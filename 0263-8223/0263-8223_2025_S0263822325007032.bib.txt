abstract = {Although carbon fiber composite cables have been proposed for decades, studies on their fatigue behavior remain limited, restricting broader engineering applications. This study focuses on the damage evolution of carbon fiber composite cables under static and cyclic loading, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for evaluating their long-term reliability. Representative volume element models for uni-strand and 7-strand were developed based on the cables’ periodic helical geometry. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in Abaqus, and material behavior was implemented via a user-defined subroutine that incorporates the Hashin criterion and thermodynamic entropy generation. Simulation results for static tensile loading agree well with experimental data, confirming the accuracy of the proposed model. In the uni-strand model, damage under static loading initiates at the center of the cross-section and propagates outward. Under fatigue loading, the initiation region gradually shifts toward the periphery as the mean stress decreases. In the 7-strand model, damage consistently initiates at the contact regions between adjacent side strands. For fatigue life prediction, a relative S–N curve was constructed. However, due to the limited experimental data, parameter calibration has yet to be completed, and quantitative analysis is left for future work.}
