abstract = {Perovskite-based structures and devices have gained tremendous research interest in a wide range of engineering applications yet their mechanical characteristics under combined multi-physics fields remains poorly understood. This paper fills in this gap by investigating the opto-electro-thermo-mechano multi-physics field-induced buckling and free vibration of annular perovskite plates with the effects of photostriction, electrostriction, and thermal expansion properties of hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 crystals being taken into account. Governing equations of the plate are obtained within the framework of the first-order shear deformation plate theory and Lagrange equation method and are solved by employing the Chebyshev-Ritz method. A comprehensive parametric study is conducted to show the effects of light illumination, electric field, temperature change, and mechanical loading on the elastic buckling behavior and free vibration characteristics of the plate. It is found that the combined action of multi-physics fields considerably affects the stability and the fundamental frequency of the perovskite plate, indicating that it is necessary and of great significance to well understand and include the effect of opto-electro-thermo-mechano multi-physics field in structural analysis of perovskite structures for more accurate and reliable engineering design.}
