abstract = {In laminated composites, delamination is one of the most detrimental mechanisms capable of considerably compromising the load-bearing capacity of structures. One of the parameters that is crucial in evaluating the propagation of a delamination crack is the mode mixity, which defines the relative contribution of mode II strain energy release rate. Due to its structural applications, the in-plane delamination behaviour of PEKK-FC, commercially known as APC, is of high importance and thus considered in this study by using non-destructive techniques including Acoustic Emission (AE) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Besides the meticulous delamination fracture characterization of APC, the potential of AE in predicting the mode mixity in symmetrical and unidirectional specimens, for which theoretical solutions for calculating the decomposed strain energy release rate values are available, is assessed. A supervised classification model is trained using the AE activity of the delamination tests under mode I and mode II loading and then successfully evaluated by considering the data coming from different mode mixity values. At the end, the AE activity of mode I versus mode II is further scrutinized, and it is shown that for the case of APC, the attenuation of AE waves is more pronounced under mode I.}
