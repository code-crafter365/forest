abstract = {This study investigates the numerical simulation of low-velocity impact (LVI) and compression after impact (CAI) in composite laminates using an explicit finite element (FE) framework based on the Floating Node Method (FNM). The performance of the explicit FNM model and its implicit counterpart were compared for three LVI and one CAI cases. The explicit framework integrates advanced failure models to simulate matrix cracking, fiber damage, and delamination, while geometric nonlinearity is addressed through an updated Lagrangian formulation. Results show that the explicit FNM method accurately predicts load–displacement behavior, damage evolution, and residual strength, demonstrating strong agreement with experimental data and improved computational efficiency compared to the implicit approach. These findings highlight the potential of the explicit FNM framework for efficient and accurate analysis of composite impact and post-impact performance with discrete crack models (DCMs).}
