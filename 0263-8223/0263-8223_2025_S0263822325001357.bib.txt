abstract = {This paper proposed a unified dynamic model for investigating the stochastic vibration behaviors of functionally graded graphene platelets reinforced composite (FG-GPLRC) joined conical-cylindrical-conical shell with variable taper under moving random loads by employing differential quadrature finite element method (DQFEM) and pseudo excitation method (PEM) and Newmark-β method on the basis of the first order shear deformation shell theory (FSDST) in conjunction with the modified Halpin–Tsai model and rule of mixture. The adjacent shell segments are connected by means of common nodes and the boundary conditions of FG-GPLRC joined conical-cylindrical-conical shell with variable taper are simulated by employing penalty function method. Four distributions of GPLs and two moving paths are considered. Then, the effective of the proposed model are verified by convergence analysis and model verification. Finally, the stochastic vibration behaviors of FG-GPLRC joined conical-cylindrical-conical shell with variable taper under moving random loads are investigated systematically by investigating the effects of model parameters including the distribution of GPLs, weight fraction of GPLs, observation position, moving path, semi-vertex angle, thickness and radius on the power spectral density (PSD) and time-varying root mean square (RMS) of displacement response. This investigation can offer the theoretical basis for predicting the stochastic vibration behaviors of FG-GPLRC joined conical-cylindrical-conical shell with variable taper under moving random loads.}
