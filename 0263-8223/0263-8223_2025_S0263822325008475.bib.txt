abstract = {This study introduces an innovative Eccentric Compression Bending (ECB) test designed for in situ tomography, aimed at isolating and characterizing the damage onset in 3D woven composites under bending loads. ECB testing facilitates damage analysis imposing a controlled eccentricity, which induces a bending-compression ratio suitable for real-time monitoring of damage initiation mechanisms using acoustic emission and x-ray computed tomography. Key advancements include a novel test setup and an interruption protocol based on AE to halt testing loads precisely at initial damage. The results highlight distinct damage initiation mechanisms for in-axis and off-axis specimens. In-axis specimens reveal initial damage in the form of intra-yarn transverse cracking under tensile stresses and yarn debonding under compression, while off-axis specimens show a complex array of matrix-dominated mechanisms, such as inter-yarn cracking and yarn-matrix debonding, under a multi-axial stress state.}
