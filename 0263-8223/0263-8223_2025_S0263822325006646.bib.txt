abstract = {Functionally graded graphene reinforced composites have demonstrated tremendous potential in defense, aerospace, and other fields due to their exceptional properties such as high stiffness and lightweight characteristics. But the existing numerical simulation methods for these materials didn’t align well with existing theoretical analysis methods. To address this issue, this work developed a multiscale finite element analysis model for functionally graded graphene reinforced aluminum matrix composites. The results calculated based on this model could well match certain theoretical analysis models. In addition, the model could take into account not only the microstructural characteristics of the composites, but also the effects of graphene vacancy defects that were unavoidable during the experimental fabrication process. Further, this work also gave the influence mechanism of factors such as vacancy defect type, vacancy defect location, vacancy defect size, and vacancy defect shape on the mechanical properties of this composites. With the model proposed in this work, it is expected to provide guidance for analysing the material properties and mechanical properties of similar functionally graded polymer matrix composites in practical engineering applications.}
