abstract = {This study explores the electrothermal properties of a new glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite with embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) film, aimed at enhancing anti-icing and de-icing efficiencies in marine and aerospace applications. Produced using the floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method, the CNT film was integrated within glass fiber/phenolic resin layers. Evaluations included microstructure characterization, thermal analysis, and mechanical testing, which confirmed the composite’s integrity and performance. The tests demonstrated the CNT film’s efficient Joule heating capabilities under various electrical loads, achieving rapid heating to operational temperatures. Additionally, the GFRP/CNT film composite displayed superior mechanical properties and effective de-icing potential, suggesting broader applications in industries needing robust, lightweight, and thermally controllable materials. This advancement significantly enhances the structural and functional capacities of materials used in marine vessels and aerospace.}
