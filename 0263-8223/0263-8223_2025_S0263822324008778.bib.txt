abstract = {Delamination defects are prone to occur during the production and use of carbon fiber composites, which seriously affect the mechanical properties of the material. The production cost of carbon fiber composites is high, and it is difficult to create defect samples. In light of this, a method for ultrasonic testing of delamination defects in carbon fiber composites based on finite element simulation was studied, and the test results were evaluated accordingly. First, a finite element model of the carbon fiber composite material was established using COMSOL software, and ultrasonic testing was employed to detect delamination defects of varying sizes and positions. Next, ultrasonic detection signals and sound field cloud images were obtained through simulation. Finally, quantitative positioning detection was conducted by fabricating laminated carbon fiber composite samples with embedded delamination defects. The results indicate that the finite element model accurately reflects the sound field propagation of ultrasonic waves. The simulated and experimental waveform signals show high consistency in both amplitude and time-domain positioning, with an error margin within 3%. The simulation model exhibits good reliability. This study provides a time-saving, labor-saving, and cost-effective approach for the detection and analysis of defects in carbon fiber composites.}
