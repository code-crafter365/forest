abstract = {Lattice structures are increasingly adopted in various engineering fields due to their superior mechanical properties. This paper presents a novel methodology for designing and optimizing three-dimensional lattice structures based on the moving morphable components approach, integrating machine learning techniques to improve computational efficiency. The method models lattice structures with spatially varying material distributions, leveraging components with explicit geometric parameters. A gradient effect is achieved through partitioned coordinate mapping based on B-Spline basis function, enabling the adjustment of strut thickness, cellular shape, and local orientation while maintaining perfect connectivity. To address the computational challenges associated with large-scale finite element analysis, a problem-independent machine learning model is employed to capture the mechanical responses of complex structures. Numerical results validate that the proposed method can produce graded lattice structures with smooth topological transitions across adjacent microstructures under various boundary conditions, notably improving the load-bearing capacity compared to periodic lattices. Moreover, the problem-independent machine learning method significantly enhances computational efficiency in complex lattice composite structure design and provides promising insights for the future application of machine learning in large-scale structural optimization.}
