abstract = {Lightweight plain-woven fabrics with improved inter-laminar shear properties are suitable candidates for manufacturing bistable reeled composite (BRC) booms that require multiple ultra-thin layers. BRCs are typically constructed with antisymmetrical laminate stacking sequences with certain fibre orientation angles, which introduce laps during the production of extremely long BRCs with plain-woven fabrics. This paper focuses on computational and experimental analyses of lapped plain-woven BRCs during snap through and coiling up. The effects of lap joints on the bistability and damage during snap-through and coiling-up processes for antisymmetrically laminated carbon/epoxy plain-woven BRCs with and without lap joints were investigated. The results indicate that a larger driving force is required for lapped BRCs than for those without lap joints to reach the critical load during snap through, and this requirement increases with increasing lap length. To investigate the damage behaviours of the BRCs during the coiling-up process, strain-gauge measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests of the damaged area were conducted. The results show that tensile fracture of the resin is the primary failure mode during equal-sense coiling up, whereas both tensile fracture of the resin and fibre damage occur during opposite-sense coiling up.}
