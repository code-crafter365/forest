abstract = {The present research focusses on detecting and localizing different types of damage occurring in a hybrid metal-composite specimen (HMCS) used for building autonomous underwater vehicles through ultrasonic guided waves and permanently attached piezoelectric transducers (PZT). A suitable wave excitation frequency is selected for conducting numerical simulations based on the wave-structure analysis and dispersion diagrams obtained for the HMCS. Accordingly, a Gaussian-windowed tone burst signal centered at a unique frequency of 250 kHz is applied at the PZT to generate guided ultrasonic waves in the test specimen. It is found that, in addition to the higher order guided wave modes, Scholte wave mode is generated and propagates along the water–solid interface. In case of damaged specimens, mode conversion of excited wave mode is observed because of the wave mode-damage interaction. The comparison of time-domain signals obtained from the pristine and damaged specimens shows additional wave packets emerging from the damage to be propagating within the damaged specimens. The corresponding time-domain signals can be processed to detect as well as locate the damage in the specimen. Further, quantitative characterization of different types of damage reveals that an accurate estimation of damage size may not be feasible due to leaking of trapped wave energy within the damaged region to surrounding water. Moreover, the influence of propagation distance on the damage detection is found to be highly sensitive and reveals that an analysis of both in-plane and out-of-plane wave displacements is mandatory to get a reliable estimate of damage detection. Lastly, wave scattering across the damage calculated based on the maximum amplitude of Hilbert envelope shows a direction dependent behavior and an increase of wave amplitude with increase of damage size at specific angular directions. The locations of damage found are well in harmony with the physical locations of damage. Experiments are conducted for all cases considered in the numerical simulations and a good agreement is observed between both. Thus, the proposed methodology is deemed suitable to investigate the structural integrity of submerged HMCS non-destructively using ultrasonic waves and permanently attached cost-effective PZT sensors.}
