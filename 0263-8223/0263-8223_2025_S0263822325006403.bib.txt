abstract = {Building upon traditional linear vibration absorbers, a nonlinear dynamic vibration absorber (n-DVA) incorporating nonlinear springs is developed. Simultaneously accounting for both geometric nonlinearity and connection nonlinearity, a multivariate nonlinear dynamic analysis is performed on the coupled system comprising a double-layer lattice sandwich circular plate with functionally graded carbon nanotube (FG-CNT) face sheets (DLLSCP-CNT) and n-DVA. Based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT), the Spectro-Geometric Method (SGM) combined with the incremental harmonic balance (IHB) method is employed to derive the nonlinear amplitude-frequency responses of the DLLSCP-CNT under n-DVA interaction, which is further analyzed together with nonlinear time-domain characteristics and displacement spectra under harmonic excitation. The convergence and accuracy of the proposed nonlinear coupled system model are rigorously validated through extensive numerical benchmarks against existing literature and numerical solutions. Leveraging this validated model, parametric investigations are systematically conducted on critical design factors including typology and stiffness characteristics of n-DVA, non-uniform CNT distribution across face sheets, non-uniform thickness distribution of three-layer skins in sandwich structures, lattice geometric configurations and Rayleigh damping coefficients, which pioneers the dynamic characterization of coupled systems incorporating both structural geometric nonlinearities and nonlinear interconnections in vibration absorbers.}
