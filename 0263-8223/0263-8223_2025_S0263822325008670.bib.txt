abstract = {Cement-based mortar has been widely used in the construction industry for hundreds of years due to its excellent mechanical properties, including structural integrity and durability. To further enhance the performance of cement-based mortars, the addition of fibers has emerged as a method to improve their mechanical characteristics. However, a deeper understanding of the material’s behavior is essential. A crucial aspect to consider is the material’s crack behavior, which can significantly affect the long-term safety of structures. Therefore, this study focuses on characterizing the experimental behavior of cement-based mortar using a numerical–experimental approach known as Finite Element Method Updating (FEMU). This method accounts for the heterogeneous deformation field that arises due to crack propagation. A three-point bending test was conducted using a 2D nonlinear Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) code, which is capable of representing progressive damage through a cohesive damage model found in existing literature. Additionally, for comparison purposes, crack opening displacement was measured along the crack path using optical methods. The numerical results for force and local displacements, which describe crack propagation, showed strong agreement with the experimental data. This validated the material model’s ability to accurately replicate experimental observations. Notably, it was observed that, despite significant variations in material parameters from the plain mortar to the fiber-reinforced specimens, these variations did not correlate directly with the force-CMOD curve. For instance, the maximum force remained relatively unchanged, even with variations of approximately 24% and 63% for the maximum tensile strength and the fracture energy parameter, respectively. This suggests that the maximum force is influenced by a combination of these damage material parameters and additional factors related to heterogeneous deformation, all of which were effectively captured by the FEMU approach. A sensitivity analysis is included to further support this observation. The results indicate that implementing the FEMU approach contributes to obtaining reliable material parameters, enhancing the accuracy of the cohesive model. The FEMU approach provided a comprehensive analysis of the three-point bending test, offering valuable insights into the material behavior under heterogeneous stress conditions, its relationship to the force-CMOD curve, and its implications for modeling strategies. Moreover, this methodology allows for the modification of damage model, testing of other literature models and incorporation of additional experimental data.}
