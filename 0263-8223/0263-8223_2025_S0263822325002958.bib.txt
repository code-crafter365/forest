abstract = {The preloading process of composite structure constrained by multiple bolted joints is difficult to be controlled because the elastic interaction between bolts and the creep relaxation of multi-layer viscoelastic structures exist simultaneously. In this paper, an optimization method of preload for multi-constraint composite structure is proposed by combining elastic interaction and long-term load relaxation. The composite structure is equivalent to the viscoelastic multi-layer structure and the load caused by creep relaxation for the multiple bolts is derived based on the viscoelastic constitutive model. The elastic interaction of bolts in relaxation process is considered and the interactive stiffness of multiple bolts is constructed. The iterative algorithm for the preload coupled with creep relaxation and elastic interaction is established. The attenuation behavior of the preload with different initial preloads and sequences for multi-constraint composite structure can be predicted. A data-driven surrogate model for the prediction of preload evolution is established, by which the variation of preload with different preloading processes can be calculated rapidly. Then, the magnitude and uniformity of preload are taken as the optimized objective and the optimal initial preloading parameters are solved, which is useful for the manufacturing of multi-constraint composite structures with long-term storage.}
