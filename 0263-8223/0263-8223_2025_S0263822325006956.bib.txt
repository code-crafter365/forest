abstract = {Lightweight structures with superior mechanical and acoustic properties hold significant application value in personal functional protective helmets. However, However, existing helmet sandwich research emphasizes mechanical protection while neglecting sound insulation. Inspired by bionic principles, this paper proposes a bionic structure suitable for helmet sandwich configurations that concurrently optimizes both mechanical and acoustic performance. Through experimental and numerical simulation methods, we systematically investigate the energy dissipation mechanisms and acoustic response patterns of the bionic structure, establishing a regulation model for layered rotational angles to modulate mechanical-acoustic performance. The results demonstrate that the layered rotational bionic design effectively restructures deformation patterns, significantly enhancing energy absorption by 323 % in the Bionic Hexagon Helical Structure (BHHS) compared to conventional configurations. Acoustically, the bionic structure achieves over 30 dB sound transmission loss across the frequency of 500–4000 Hz, with an average sound insulation exceeding 40 dB, demonstrating exceptional noise reduction capability. Furthermore, the rotational angles profoundly influence both mechanical response modes and acoustic energy dissipation mechanisms. This study achieves synergistic optimization of mechanical protection and sound insulation through bionic strategies, providing a new paradigm for the design of multifunctional protective equipment.}
