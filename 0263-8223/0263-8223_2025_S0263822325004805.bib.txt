abstract = {In the present work, an intelligent magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) radial phononic crystal (PnC) is constructed for the vibration control of rotary structures, and the torsional wave propagation in this PnC is evaluated. A coupled MEE overlapping finite element method (OFEM) model is developed for efficient dynamic analyses of the MEE-based structures by reducing the significant numerical dispersions in standard finite element model. Two numerical tests demonstrate that the multi-physical responses of the MEE-based systems can be accurately derived by the proposed numerical model using coarse meshes. Thereafter, the torsional wave propagation of the MEE radial PnC is calculated using this high-performance OFEM to investigate the band gap properties. Furthermore, the impact of some important parameters (the multi-physics coupling effect and the inner radius) of the PnC on its band gap properties is evaluated. This study introduces a highly efficient numerical scheme for the dynamic analyses of MEE-based devices, and the discussion about the MEE radial PnCs could potentially aid in the advancement of research on smart PnCs.}
