abstract = {In the published literature, a great deal of experimental data has been used to construct machine learning-based models to predict the stress–strain relationships of polymers. However, due to differences in material properties and molding process, these published experimental data can be directly used to train machine learning-based models of the designated thermoplastic polymers. In addition, the stress–strain relationships of the same type of thermoplastic polymers exhibit approximate trends. Therefore, the authors are inspired to use these published data as training data to build the machine learning-based model, so the usage of experimental data can be reduced. To this end, a novel strategy is suggested to build a Multi-Fidelity Data-driven Model (MFDM) through the hierarchical Kriging model. Firstly, extensive published data is used to construct a low-fidelity model in MFDM, which can describe the rough shape of the stress–strain relationships. Subsequently, a small number of experimental data are employed to construct the high-fidelity model in MFDM, which can accurately describe the stress–strain relationships of the designated thermoplastic polymers. The suggested strategy and the MFDM are initially demonstrated with an analytical example. Moreover, a two-dimensional MFDM and a three-dimensional MFDM are constructed for Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone (PEEK), and a three-dimensional MFDM is established for Polycarbonate(PC) to assess the application for other polymers. The predicted stress–strain relationships are compared with experimental results to assess the accuracy of the proposed MFDM, and linear regression analyses are performed to evaluate the generalization capability of the MFDM. The current results demonstrate that the proposed strategy and MFDM can accurately capture the temperature and strain-rate-dependent stress–strain relationships of PEEK and PC using only a small amount of experimental data. The proposed approach reduces the required experimental data by more than 70% compared to the existing machine learning-based model. The insight gained from this work is that by sufficiently utilizing the existing data and supplementing a small amount of experimental data for training, an accurate model can be obtained, which can significantly reduce experimental costs.}
