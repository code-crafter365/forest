abstract = {Due to its lightweight and high strength, beam-like structures made of composite laminates have been widely used in critical components in turbomachinery engineering practice. The anisotropic and non-prismatic characteristics of composite beam-like structures, e.g. wind turbine blades and helicopter rotors, pose challenges to the efficiency and accuracy of structural dynamic numerical models. Furthermore, conventional implicit or explicit time-marching schemes in finite element method (FEM) for beam models always suffer from accuracy degradation or conditionally numerical stability issues when the time step is enlarged. To address this problem, a novel unconditionally stable explicit finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was proposed to solve the equations governing composite beam dynamics. Interestingly, FDTD has been the most renowned and popular numerical method in computational electrodynamics for decades. Compared with conventional implicit or explicit time-marching FEM method, the proposed unconditionally stable explicit FDTD method can enlarge the time step without accuracy degradation, thereby enhancing the efficiency of dynamic simulations of composite beams.}
