abstract = {With the gradual development of stiff-flexible coupled and deformable composite materials, the needle-punching process, due to its flexible forming advantages, shows broad application prospects in the local reinforcement of preforms. However, the inter-layer performance of 3D needle-punched preforms remains weak, and the influence of needle-punching process parameters on inter-layer performance is yet to be quantified. Therefore, this study explores the effect of needle-punching paths on the inter-layer performance of preforms and proposes a unified path generation and decomposition (UPD-PPO-MOGA) method, which combines proximal policy optimization (PPO) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), to generate uniform, discrete, and low-redundancy needle-punching paths to improve the inter-layer performance of needle-punched preforms. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that prioritizing inter-layer overlap, followed by uniformity, and finally in-plane overlap, is crucial for achieving superior inter-layer performance. The resulting preforms showed a 55% and 70.15% increase in peeling energy and a 32.36% and 41.22%.}
