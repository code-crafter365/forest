abstract = {The barely visible impact damage (BVID) sustained by composite structures will pose significant safety hazards if not promptly detected. The existing detection methods, including surface-mounted sensors, cannot be used to accurately monitor the internal damage of composite materials online. In this paper, a new method of damage detection for carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) during the impact process is proposed based on the correlation between strain distribution through the thickness and damage by using a stereo optic fiber sensor network embedded between CFRP interlayers. In this method, the strain correlation based on the strain distribution through the thickness under the impact load is constructed, and a damage index DI-IR is proposed according to the change of strain relationship to judge the damage state. This method can effectively provide online monitoring and identification of CFRP impact damage in the experiment.}
