abstract = {The multi-riveted-bonded joint combines mechanical fastening and adhesive bonding to offer superior static and fatigue performance, and is widely used in industrial applications. However, its numerous design parameters and their strong interdependencies make it difficult to establish an accurate surrogate model for mechanical performance. This study focuses on carbon fiber reinforced polymer/aluminum alloy (CFRP/Al) multi-riveted-bonded joints and introduces an innovative sampling scheme, the chessboard combination sampling (CCS). This approach resolves the parameter coupling problem and unifies the dimensions of input variables for the surrogate model. An automated parametric modeling process was then used to obtain finite element analysis data and construct a database for training the Kriging model. The surrogate model’s input includes global geometric variables such as overlap area, rivet count, size, position, and material thickness, while the output predicts the joint’s stiffness and strength with over 93 % accuracy. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted using the established surrogate model and database to assess the impact of design parameters on the structure’s stiffness and strength. The surrogate model enhances the efficiency of predicting mechanical performance for multi-riveted-bonded joints and provides a robust methodology for the analysis and design of similar structures in engineering applications.}
