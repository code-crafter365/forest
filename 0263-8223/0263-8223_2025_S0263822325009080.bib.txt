abstract = {Accurately and efficiently predicting the damage probability (Pk/h) for composite structures subjected to warhead fragment impact remains a critical challenge in vulnerability reduction design and real-time battlefield survivability analysis. To address this challenge, a surrogate model-based framework (SMBF) is proposed in this study, consisting of four sequential stages: experimental testing, high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulation, surrogate modeling, and Pk/h prediction. During the experimental testing stage, the primary damage modes and structural characteristics are identified through explosion impact tests and residual strength tests, which serve to validate the FE simulation methodology. In the high-fidelity FE simulation stage, a finite element modeling method, validated through basic experiments, is developed to simulate shear damage in impacted structures, with simulation results showing strong agreement with experimental data on residual strength. In the surrogate modeling stage, three surrogate models—Kriging, PRS, and RBF neural network—are trained and evaluated using the FE simulation dataset focused on structural residual strength. These models enable efficient prediction of residual strength, with the RBF model demonstrating the highest accuracy. Finally, based on the RBF model and the Monte Carlo method, a Pk/h prediction approach is established, capable of efficiently estimating the damage probability of composite structures while accounting for uncertainties in damage parameters. To validate the proposed SMBF framework, a representative aircraft-grade carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) stiffened plate is selected as a case study. Compared to conventional experimental and FE-based approaches, SMBF achieves significantly higher computational efficiency while preserving sufficient predictive accuracy. This approach offers valuable insights into time-sensitive damage assessment, supporting both structural design optimization and mission planning processes.}
