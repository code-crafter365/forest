abstract = {This paper investigated experimentally the shear performance of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) deep beams reinforced longitudinally with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars without web reinforcements. Ten beams were cast, in which seven were longitudinally reinforced with GFRP bars, while the remaining three were reinforced with steel bars for comparison. All beams had similar lengths and widths of 2000 mm and 150 mm, respectively, while the depths varied. The test parameters included the effective depth (d), shear span-to-depth ratio (a/d), number of longitudinal bars, and longitudinal reinforcement ratio (ρ). All the GFRP reinforced beams had higher shear capacities and lower post cracking stiffness than their steel counterparts. The experimental results show that varying the test parameters have a significant impact on the shear capacity of the beams. For instance, decreasing the a/d ratio for the GFRP reinforced beams from 1.8 to 1.5 and from 1.8 to 1.1 increased the load carrying capacity by 33 % and 95 %, respectively. The experimental results for the shear capacity were compared against the predictions obtained using the strut and tie method as per the ACI-318–19 and CSA-S806-12 codes. The failure load predictions by the ACI and CSA code showed the same trends as those shown in the experimental results. Moreover, both codes were conservative in predicting the shear capacities.}
