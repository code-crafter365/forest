abstract = {In this paper, multiple holes’ interaction effects on the progressive damage process and ultimate strength of T700/epoxy notched composite laminates under uniaxial tension are studied by experiment and the local to global (L2G) method. Failure mechanisms of multiple layup composite laminates with different hole distances and diameter ratios are analyzed, and the L2G’s predictions are in agreement with experimental results, which demonstrates the L2G has an excellent numerical capability to capture multiple damage modes in composite laminates. Moreover, it is found that multi holes composite laminates with reasonable hole spacing and diameter ratio have a higher strength than single-hole composite laminates, and the relationships between the ultimate strength and hole spacing/diameter ratio are also discussed.}
