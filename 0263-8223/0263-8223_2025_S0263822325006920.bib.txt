abstract = {The connection stage constitutes a critical process in the assembly of composite panels. A profound comprehension of the key factors influencing assembly quality is conducive to attaining a superior balance between structural performance and assembly production efficiency. This paper employed a multi-scale modeling approach to characterize the assembly stress and assembly deformation during the connection stage of large-sized composite panels. This method utilized typical elements with homogeneous anisotropy to equivalently represent the heterogeneity of composite laminates, effectively reducing the modeling complexity of large-sized composite panels. Finite element models for the assembly connection of composite panels were established, and a decoupling analysis was conducted on influencing factors such as the initial assembly condition and assembly process parameters. The results emphasized the substantial influence of the local assembly gap on the assembly stress and deformation of the composite panel, and corresponding assembly technical requirements were subsequently proposed. The method proposed in this study contributes to enhancing the analysis efficiency of large-sized composite structures, thereby facilitating the prediction and control of stress and deformation during the assembly process.}
