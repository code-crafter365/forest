abstract = {Carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites are widely used as structural components in industry and are subjected to mechanical loads. However, once heated, the flammable and decomposable nature of the epoxy matrix can lead to structural damage under thermo-mechanical coupling. This article prepared flame-retardant carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites with high mechanical properties based on an epoxy matrix of TGDDM, which possess a high flame retardancy grade (V-0) and tensile strength (1488 MPa). By utilizing an independently constructed thermo-mechanical coupling experimental platform, a comparative study is conducted with commonly used DGEBA epoxy composites, and it is found that the sample can maintain its structural and functional integrity under heating conditions at 300 °C. Further research is conducted on the glass transition and pyrolysis characteristics of the samples, and a thermo-mechanical coupling failure model for the composite materials is established based on kinetic parameters. It accurately predicts the surface temperature and failure time of the materials. This work will provide new ideas for the prediction and prevention of the thermo-mechanical coupling failure process of composite materials.}
