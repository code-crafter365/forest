abstract = {This study establishes a design framework for optimizing lay-up angles in filament-wound CFRP tubular structures under low-velocity impact (15 J). A systematic experimental–numerical approach integrating drop hammer tests, finite element analysis (FEA), and micro-CT imaging was employed to investigate five lay-up configurations (±15°–±65°). Key findings reveal a trade-off between impact resistance and energy absorption: ±45° lay-ups (moderate-angle regime) achieve balanced performance (80.2 % energy absorption, 29.4 % residual deformation), while ± 65° configurations prioritize energy dissipation (87.6 % absorption) at the cost of increased deformation. FEA-validated micro-CT imaging elucidates damage mechanisms: shallow-angle regimes (<±30°) induce resin-dominated delamination, whereas steep-angle regimes (>±60°) promote fiber fracture through shear-stress redistribution. The study provides a quantitative basis for angle-specific design in aerospace and automotive applications requiring multi-objective performance optimization.}
