abstract = {Slender composite structures can be modeled using engineering beam models with properties computed using a cross-sectional analysis program, such as VABS. These properties are given in terms of the mass matrix, stiffness matrix, and compliance matrix in a general coordinate system. The invariance of strain energy and kinetic energy is employed to rigorously transform sectional properties into different coordinate systems with parallel shifts and rotations. Additionally, the computation of commonly used inertial properties (mass center, principal inertial axes, and mass moments of inertia) from the mass matrix, and commonly used elastic properties (extension stiffness, bending stiffness, torsion stiffness, tension center, shear center, principal bending axes, principal shear axes, etc.) from the compliance matrix, is elucidated. The elastic properties are given for both the Timoshenko model and the Euler–Bernoulli model. The definitions for shear center and twist center are clarified and consistently generalized for composite beams. Isotropic homogeneous beams are used to illustrate how to relate commonly used engineering beam properties with the compliance matrix and the stiffness matrix for composite beams. Finally, engineering beam properties necessary for general-purpose aeromechanical analysis programs such as CAMRAD II are derived from the properties computed by VABS.}
