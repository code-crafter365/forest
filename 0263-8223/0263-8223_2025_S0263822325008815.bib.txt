abstract = {Since the thermally assisted joining metals and carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) is a process with the complicated interfacial reaction mechanism, accurately modeling its process–structure–strength relationship is a challenge study. This study aims to develop an interpretable data-driven framework to predict Al/CFRTP joining strength from idealized hot-press joining conditions and interfacial microstructural features. Experimental characterization and heat transfer simulation were performed to collect data of temperature, pressure, thermal history, interfacial and defect features. Key variables were transformed into dimensionless forms, and gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) models were trained to predict the strength with high accuracy (R2 > 0.90). A simplified mathematical model was distilled from the GBDT and described using authors’ proposed simple equations, which exhibit sufficient accuracy for practical application. The results indicate that moderate temperatures and sufficient residence time enhance chemical bonding and interfacial contact, thereby improving strength. However, excessive heat input can lead to decomposition and defect growth in CFRTP, significantly reducing performance. Interfacial contact ratio and Raman intensity are positively correlated with strength, while defect size and count negatively impact strength. This work provides a physically generalizable modeling approach to metal/CFRTP joining, facilitating process optimization and a deeper understanding of joint performance in hybrid structures.}
