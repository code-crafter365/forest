abstract = {Vibrational energy focusing is of significant interest in fields such as energy harvesting, particularly with the emergence of smart structures and self-powered technologies. This paper presents the design and manufacturing approach for Gradient-Index (GRIN) lenses using composite materials. As a proof of concept, the strategy implemented here focuses on controlling the fiber mass ratio of a unidirectional (UD) composite at constant thickness. Mechanical properties must be carefully controlled throughout a dedicated manufacturing process to achieve a gradient of phase velocity for focusing elastic flexural waves. Numerical calculation have demonstrated the efficiency of energy focusing within a frequency range from 2 kHz to 8 kHz. A manufacturing process has been developed to prototype a composite structure that integrates the designed GRIN lens. Additionally, the comparison of a numerical model with experimental results from a manufactured lens structure reveals that the energy density in a defined focusing zone can be increased sevenfold using a gradient lens composite structure, with an incident wave of 8 kHz.}
