abstract = {Functionally graded materials (FGM) has garnered increasing attention due to their good mechanical performance. However, modeling the nonlinear behavior of FGM remains challenging. Many studies used the finite element method (FEM) to analyze elastoplastic behavior of FGM but additional material setting treatments were required. The proposed Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model has implicit material data on each particle, which is automatically affected following the FGM rule of material thickness variation. The SPH method was proved to be effective in the simulation of elastic deformation of FGM. FGM often experiences elastoplastic deformation in real applications when loads exceed elastic limits. This study addresses this need by developing a Total Lagrangian SPH formulation for elastoplastic bending in FGM, providing accurate simulations of this critical material response. The cutting plane algorithm has been implemented for updating plastic strains and stresses within the SPH formulation to efficiently enforce yield surface conditions during the elastoplastic deformation. The in-house SPH code was validated by comparing deflection curves with reference data, and the strain/stress distribution with ABAQUS under various conditions. The proposed SPH model was demonstrated to stably and effectively capture the bending behavior of FGM and provide solutions comparable to those obtained from ABAQUS using FEM.}
