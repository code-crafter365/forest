abstract = {Self-healing polymers are used to improve the durability and strength of materials and provide them with a longer service life. The authors propose a new optical method for evaluating the self-repair efficiency in polymers containing microcapsules. The non-destructive method measures spatial profiles of a hole series obtained after a material puncture. Spatial images of holes acquired by optical coherence tomography were processed to get a surface profile. The reduction of the average volume or depth of the holes compared to the reference material allows self-healing efficiency calculation. For the presented method, tests were carried out to measure the self-repair efficiency of test materials with 5% and 10% mass of repair capsules compared to Ethe reference polymer without capsules. The volumetric efficiencies of self-repair obtained from 30 holes of each material, acquired 8 h after the puncture, were computed as 51.6% and 58.3% for the two repaired material types, respectively.}
