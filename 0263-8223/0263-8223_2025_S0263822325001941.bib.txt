abstract = {This article presents an analysis of the free vibration behavior of a three-layer sandwich plate with a nanocomposite core. The core is reinforced with Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs) to enhance its mechanical properties, which are calculated using a micromechanical approach and rule of mixtures. The top and bottom layers consist of magnetostrictive materials, introducing magneto-mechanical coupling that requires a frequency regulation parameter for accurate vibration analysis. The governing equations for each layer are derived based on third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) and are formulated using Hamilton’s principle. The differential quadrature method is then employed to solve for the plate’s vibration frequency. Key findings reveal the distinct effects of CNT and BNNT reinforcements and different matrixes on the vibration characteristics of the composite plate, as well as the effectiveness of vibration control parameters in frequency reduction. These insights have potential applications across various fields, notably in maritime and civil engineering, highlighting the practical relevance of this study.}
