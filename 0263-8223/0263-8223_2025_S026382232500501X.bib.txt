abstract = {As a composite material, its interfacial performance is vital in engineering service. Accordingly, the interfacial bonding behaviour of metakaolin-based geopolymer-concrete composites was examined, and a series of microscopic characterizations were conducted to disclose the influential mechanism and failure mode. The results reveal that the interfacial shear response of the composite was composed of the initial non-linear phase, transitional linear phase and the occurrence of a sudden bond slip. Besides, the casting interval affected the interfacial bonding behaviour significantly, and particularly, the optimum value was experimentally reported as 19 h. Either an over-short or an extended casting interval could be detrimental to the development of interfacial strength. The former was attributed to the depressed dissolution of mineral compounds in concrete, led by the quick casting of geopolymer. Also, the alkali concentration of geopolymer was diluted at the interface, which lowered the reaction degree. On the other hand, an over-long casting interval led to the geopolymerization missing the exothermic peak of concrete, which thermodynamically weakened the interaction of the two systems. Furthermore, a mechanical model is proposed and validated to predict the interfacial shear strength of metakaolin-based geopolymer-concrete composites cast at varying intervals.}
