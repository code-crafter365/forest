abstract = {This study presents a novel stress-driven formulation, incorporating Kirchhoff’s plate assumptions and accounting for the non-local size-dependent feature in both plate geometric axes, which is practical, especially near the origin of the axis in the polar coordinates. The presented formulation does not impose any additional constraints on the elastic radial curvatures, which are known as constitutive boundary conditions. Therefore, taking into account the non-local behavior in both radial and circumferential directions does not lead to an overconstrained problem. The study focuses on the analysis of a circular plate with an outer radius (R), thickness (h), and the length scale parameter (L). The governing differential equations are derived in Cartesian coordinates and then transformed to the polar coordinates to analyze circular plates. When R tends to infinity, the governing equation is solved analytically. Using the Galerkin technique, a finite element solution is presented for the analysis of a bounded circular plate with a clamped boundary condition at the outer radius R. The study discusses the size effects and the gradient properties of functionally graded plates in stress-driven non-local theory. It reveals that while increasing the non-local parameter results in a reduction of transverse displacement, the moments remain unaffected.}
