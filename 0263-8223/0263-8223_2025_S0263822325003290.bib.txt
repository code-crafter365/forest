abstract = {A constitutive model for the highly nonlinear, anisotropic, and inelastic behavior of coated woven fabrics is proposed by suitably combining different model components from the literature. The material model accounts for viscoelasticity and plastic anisotropy at finite strains and thus, enables the geometrically nonlinear simulation of engineering constructions including prestretch processes and history-dependent load protocols. The formulation is adjusted to experimental data, specifically designed to isolate the individual aspects of the model, and it shows a decent agreement with the data. A numerical integration procedure is provided and the utilization of the model in a computational setting is addressed. Through an exemplary boundary value problem replicating a simplified roof construction, the impact of the individual features of the model on the structural response are analyzed and compared with the linear elastic model commonly used in engineering practice and a competitive hyperelastic model from the literature. As a result, the model shows significant differences to the simpler formulations and is thus found beneficial for the numerical analysis of structural problems.}
