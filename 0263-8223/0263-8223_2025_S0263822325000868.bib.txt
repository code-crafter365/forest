abstract = {The optimization of bending and free vibration in an IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) model of porous sandwich Functionally Graded (FG) plates with Graphene nanoPlateLet (GPL) reinforcement is a bi-objective optimization problem. To solve the optimization problem of this IGA model, a Multi-Objective Blood-Sucking Leech Optimizer (MOBSLO) is proposed by integrating an archive, a grid mechanism and a leader selection mechanism into the recently developed Blood-Sucking Leech Optimizer (BSLO). The optimization performance of MOBSLO is evaluated using CEC 2009 test functions. In comparison with three multi-objective optimization algorithms, MOBSLO obtains the highest number of optimal average Generational Distance (GD), Inverse Generational Distance (IGD), SPacing (SP), and Maximum Spread (MS) metrics, accounting for 60%, 60%, 70%, 60%, respectively. In addition, the superiority of MOBSLO for CEC 2009 test functions is also demonstrated by the Pareto optimal fronts it obtained, which are closer to the true Pareto fronts than those from other algorithms. Finally, the winning MOBSLO is performed to optimize the bending and free vibration in an IGA model of sandwich FG plates. The convex Pareto optimal fronts obtained by MOBSLO, along with corresponding parameter analysis can provide a guidance for the optimization design of the porous sandwich FG IGA model.}
