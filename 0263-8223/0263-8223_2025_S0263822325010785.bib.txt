abstract = {This study presents the development and evaluation of a hybrid multifunctional structural battery. The battery features a glass fiber-reinforced polymer shell bonded with surface-treated metallic current collectors, forming a mechanically robust structure. Lithium iron phosphate was used as the cathode, graphite as the anode, and a plain-weave glass fiber incorporating a composite polymer electrolyte matrix served as the structural solid-state electrolyte. The mechanical performance was assessed using quasi-static indentation tests on both sides of the structural battery, and results were benchmarked against equivalent hybrid structures and an all-GFRP configuration. Computed tomography imaging was employed to detect internal damage across the various tested configurations. Energy storage performance was evaluated using potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge–discharge cycling, and the results were compared with those of reference coin cells and state-of-the-art structural batteries. The hybrid structural battery had a tensile and bending stiffness of 40.5 GPa and 26.4 GPa, respectively, and exhibited superior damage tolerance, while demonstrating a Coulombic efficiency of 93% with a cycle life of 550, effectively combining load-bearing capability with energy storage.}
