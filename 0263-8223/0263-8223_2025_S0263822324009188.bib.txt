abstract = {To improve the dynamic compression behavior of triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice and further enhance the energy absorption characteristics, a hybrid TPMS lattice with circular transition was designed. Axial impact experiments validated the finite element model’s accuracy, showing that Hybrid-TPMS lattices effectively improve the local deformation of Uniform-TPMS lattices under axial impact conditions. Among them, the Hybrid-D-P lattice showed the most significant effect, with a 64.5% and 15.4% improvement in mean crushing force and crushing force efficiency, while effective compression displacement decreased by 35.5%, compared to its component lattice Uniform-P. It is proved that the lattice with excellent energy absorption in the central region and the lattice with low energy absorption in the outside can effectively enhance the hybridization effect. Meanwhile, the energy absorption characteristics of Hybrid-TPMS lattices with different component proportions showed that by designing the transition radius, the optimal combination of the advantages of two TPMS lattices can be achieved. The overall stiffness and strength of Hybrid-TPMS lattices were enhanced at higher relative densities, thus improving the load-bearing capacity and energy absorption characteristics. Finally, the axial impact theoretical models of Hybrid-TPMS lattices were predicted and verified using Gibson–Ashby theory, with an error of less than 5%.}
