abstract = {This study investigates the mechanical properties of PP/jute fabric laminates in different weave configurations (Satin, Serge 2x2, and Taffetas), focusing on toughness, stress intensity, energy restitution rate, and fracture energies. The results show a narrow toughness range (2.9 to 3.7 MPa.m1/2) across configurations. Stress intensity factor peaks at 6 MPa.m1/2 for three composites, with one (Bio-Com B) reaching 8.5 MPa.m1/2. Energy restitution rate increases with crack growth, with Bio-Com B exceeding others at 24 kJ/m2. Fracture energy trends are consistent across materials, with weave having a notable influence on properties beyond a specific crack growth value. The study highlights the significant effect of reinforcement architecture on laminate mechanical properties, especially in fracture energy and crack growth resistance. It concludes that recycled jute/PP composites offer promising, sustainable alternatives for furniture and construction due to their superior cracking resistance and environmental benefits.}
