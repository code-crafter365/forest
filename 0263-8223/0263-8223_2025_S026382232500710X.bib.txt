abstract = {This study investigates the meshless smoothed particle Galerkin (SPG) numerical method to model the single diamond scribing of the silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide (SiCf/SiC) ceramic matrix composite. The SPG method offers two key advantages over the traditional finite element method (FEM) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Firstly, SPG is a particle method based on the Galerkin weak form which utilizes the direct nodal integration (DNI) scheme for the domain integration without background mesh. The SPG with DNI scheme can represent complex material separation directly without remeshing, significantly saving computational workload. Secondly, the bond-based failure model used in the SPG method considers the deformations of two particles associated with a bond. It has intrinsic capability to model the failures between multiple solid phases materials like SiC fibers and matrix. Various physics-based failure criteria can be assigned to bond-connected particles to precisely predict material failure behaviors within both SiC fibers and matrix, and interface debonding while preserving the integrity of damaged work-materials. The SPG-predicted forces of diamond scribing SiCf/SiC are validated against experimental measurements. The numerical results also reveal the material failure mechanisms in diamond scribing of SiCf/SiC composite, paving the way for multi-grit grinding modeling.}
