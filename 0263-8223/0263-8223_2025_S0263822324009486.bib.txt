abstract = {Conductive hydrogels (CHs) have been widely used in the design of flexible strain electrodes due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as large stretchability and high electrical conductivity. However, conductive hydrogels when aqueous solvents are used as the dispersion medium are subject to freezing and drying, which greatly limits their applications. In this study, we demonstrated an conductive hydrogel that is resistant to ambient temperature and highly stretchable by replacing part of the water in the synthesized polyacrylamide/poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/carbon nanotube hydrogel with glycerol through a simple solvent substitution strategy, which provides excellent temperature resistance and good stability without sacrificing the stretchability and conductivity. The conductive hydrogel is environmentally tolerant and is capable of effectively detecting physiological signals from the human body at both high and low temperatures.}
