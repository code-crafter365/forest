abstract = {Porous Structures(PS) distinguished by their exceptional lightweight, elevated strength, and superior thermal insulation properties, which motivate researchers to find advanced PS based on traditional topology optimization(TO). However, large number of design variables, additional manufacturing constraints, and the lack of geometric information are challenging issues in PS design. To address this, a novel explicit porous structure design method is proposed in this paper. Not only utilizing traditional circular and B-spline(BS) boundary parametric equation, but also proposing adaptive polygonal parametric equation to characterize pore boundary explicitly. As a result, the pore geometry is directly controlled via fewer design variables, and the optimization mathematical model is established without any extra manufacturing or connectivity constraint. The sensitivity of the design variable is derived based on Boundary Evolution Theory(BET). The numerical examples are optimized and simulated to substantiate the effectiveness and capacity of the proposed method.}
