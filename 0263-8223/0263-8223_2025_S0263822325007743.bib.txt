abstract = {For the first time, this paper proposes implicit strategies to functionally grade the periodicity of a sandwich core with multiple transition boundaries, and relative density, using the double Gyroid honeycomb architecture, to mitigate post-yielding bending effect common in metallic anisotropic lattices like honeycombs, and resist perforation of the composite sandwich structure with no penalty on the weight. The novel 3D-printed AlSi10Mg double gyroid honeycomb cores were sandwiched between 1.1 mm-thick woven carbon fiber-reinforced polymer skins and tested under a low-energy (120 J) drop-weight impact loading. Additionally, we simulated the effect of varying impact obliquity (90°, 60° and 45°) and projectile shape using the cubic symmetric Gyroid lattice design as the core, numerically, assuming a constant face sheet thickness, lattice-core relative density and impact energy. The impact test results showed that the first-layer transition boundaries, consisting of a 50–50 % synthesis of the periodic and honeycomb-like gyroid architectures, were crucial in resisting the perforation of the hybrid-lattice sandwich composite, due to their inherent high strength. Grading the relative density of the double gyroid honeycomb-lattice core allowed controlled deformation, leading to an improved impact performance of the sandwich composite. Varying impact trajectories highlighted the necessity for designing sheet-based minimal surface-lattice sandwich composites with cores exhibiting high uniaxial and shear strengths. Hence, this study provides an effective design strategy to control deformation mechanisms in sandwiched cores and impede perforation of the structure.}
