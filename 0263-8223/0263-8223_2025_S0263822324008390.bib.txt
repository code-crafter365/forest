abstract = {Structural polymeric composite (SPC) materials have become increasingly popular in the automotive industry due to their lightweight potential, excellent fatigue, and impact resistance, superior damping behavior, and high strength and stiffness properties. The automotive sector shows a strong interest in enhancing the repair methods for SPC. However, with immature SPC design rules, production processes, and joining technologies, the safety and efficiency of composite automotive components will heavily rely on effective structural maintenance and repair. Despite its importance, minimal progress has been made in repairing SPC materials over the past decades. Consequently, there is a pressing need to enhance composite repair practices and foster innovation in this vital area. This paper aims to address this demand by focusing on repair techniques and covering various state-of-the-art processing steps associated with SPC materials in the automotive industry. The review contributes an overview of several crucial aspects of composite repair, encompassing advanced non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for damage assessment, machining of structural composites, and surface preparation techniques. Furthermore, it delves into scarfing repair methods, such as patching and bonding, along with repair monitoring and automation, case studies, and emerging trends in composite repair technologies.}
