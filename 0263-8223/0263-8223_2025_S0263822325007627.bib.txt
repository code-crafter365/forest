abstract = {Wireless passive flexible pressure sensors demonstrate unique advantages and application prospects in real-time monitoring of confined spaces. Nevertheless, existing wireless passive flexible pressure sensors are generally confronted with the challenge that it’s difficult to simultaneously enhance sensitivity and detection accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a wireless passive pressure sensor based on composite microstructure dielectric layer and asymmetric double-square inductor. Firstly, the Polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS)-based composite dielectric layer with surface sandpaper microstructure and bulk-phase porous structure was constructed by employing the sandpaper template method and the dissolution method, which enhanced the elastic deformation response of the dielectric layer and reduced the initial capacitance. Meanwhile, the equivalent inductance value was enhanced by virtue of asymmetric double-square inductor, and the sensitivity and the quality factor (Q-factor) were synergistically optimized in conjunction with the capacitance regulation mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that the sensor achieves a maximum sensitivity of −2.52 MHz/kPa within 0–330 kPa, and the Q-factor was also improved. Additionally, a sensor array with adjusted capacitive electrode areas demonstrated crosstalk-free multi-unit detection. This sensor provides a highly sensitive and accurate wireless passive solution for biomedical and industrial applications such as human joint motion tracking, lithium battery expansion monitoring, and arterial blood pressure detection.}
