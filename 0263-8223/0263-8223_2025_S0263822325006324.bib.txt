abstract = {In this study, the suture structure was designed as the connection joint to improve mechanical interlocking capability and crashworthiness of assembled multi-cell structures. The failure mechanisms and mechanical properties of three suture interfaces were investigated by tensile tests. The suture interface with the best mechanical properties was selected as the connection joint for assembled multi-cell tubes. Quasi-static compression experiments showed that the multi-cell tube assembled with suture joints exhibited high synergy and effectively avoided the risk of tube splashing during compression. The specific energy absorption and crushing force efficiency of the assembled four-cell tube were increased by 65.8 % and 49.9 % compared to corresponding discrete tube, respectively. Based on the simplified super folding element theory and taking into account the variations in folding elements caused by suture joints, a theoretical model was established to predict the mean crushing force of assembled suture n × n-cell tube. The theoretical predictions were in good agreement with experimental studies. This study offered the potential for energy absorbers to on-demand customize their dimensions and crashworthiness to adapt to various collision environments.}
