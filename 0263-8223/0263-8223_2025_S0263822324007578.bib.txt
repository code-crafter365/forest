abstract = {Laminated composite honeycomb cellular core sandwich panels are widely utilized in various industries due to their exceptional stiffness-to-weight ratio and strength characteristics. Current analytical models often simplify honeycomb cores as homogenized continua, effectively predicting stiffness but falling short in capturing crucial failure modes, particularly shear buckling of honeycomb core walls. Existing theoretical studies on shear buckling are limited to isotropic materials and specific honeycomb geometries. While numerical models can simulate cell wall buckling, their computational demands render them impractical for large structures employing sandwich panels. This paper introduces a novel, simplified semi-analytical approach that accurately predicts the shear buckling load of laminated composite honeycomb cellular cores. The model accounts for bend-twist coupling effects and rotational restraints at laminate wall boundaries. To validate the proposed approach, predictions are compared with finite element analysis results for hexagonal honeycomb cores and cores of varying shapes, incorporating diverse fibre lay-up configurations. The findings demonstrate excellent agreement between the proposed approach and finite element analysis, indicating its reliability in predicting shear buckling. This research addresses the gap in existing methodologies by offering a practical and efficient tool for predicting shear buckling in laminated composite honeycomb cores, extending applicability beyond isotropic materials and specific honeycomb geometries. The proposed approach holds promise for optimizing the design and structural integrity of sandwich panels, impacting industries relying on these lightweight and high-performance structures.}
