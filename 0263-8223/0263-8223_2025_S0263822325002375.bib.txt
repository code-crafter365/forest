abstract = {Considering the yarn extrusion and actual spatial structure of 3D angle-interlock woven composites(3DAWCs), a geometric equation is proposed and a parametric finite element model(FEM) is established to investigate the mesoscale tensile behavior. The results demonstrate the accurate prediction of tensile properties and progressive damage of 3DAWCs by the finite element model, with experimental data validating the effectiveness. Moreover, it is revealed that the tensile behavior exhibits a strong correlation with yarn density and loading direction. Under warp tensile load, strength and modulus exhibit a positive correlation with warp density while showing a negative correlation with weft density. Under weft tensile load, both strength and modulus increase as yarn density increases. Damage analysis reveals that warp tensile damage initially occurs at warp bends and weft edges, propagating from the interface between warp and matrix. With an increase in both warp and weft yarn densities, damage under weft tensile load distribution initiates from weft yarns before extending towards interfaces between warp/weft yarns and matrix.}
