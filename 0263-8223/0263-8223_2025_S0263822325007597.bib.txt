abstract = {In order to investigate the stress–strain response characteristics and damage behavior of composite solid propellants under different temperature-stress coupling accelerated ageing conditions, this study designed three high-temperature accelerated ageing experiments and six thermomechanical coupling accelerated ageing experiments. A multi-scale characterization method combining macroscopic constant speed tensile tests with microscopic fracture morphology observations was employed to analyze the coupled effects of ageing time, temperature and stress on the macroscopic mechanical properties and microstructural evolution of the propellants. The results show that ageing stress promotes the formation of the yield platform during the “dewetting” damage stage, while also weakening the localized characteristics of crack propagation. This is manifested by an increase in the number of damaged interfaces and an expansion of the damaged area. Compared to high-temperature accelerated ageing under the same temperature, thermomechanical coupling accelerated ageing results in more pronounced hardening and embrittlement effects in the propellant. Based on the experimental results, a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model was established that considers the synergistic effects of strain history, ageing environmental parameters and damage growth. The model accurately predicts the stress–strain response under different ageing conditions. The research findings provide theoretical insights and data support for mechanical response prediction of solid rocket motors.}
