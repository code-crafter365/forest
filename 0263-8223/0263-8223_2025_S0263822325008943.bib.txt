abstract = {A low-velocity impact is one of the events that has a critical effect on the safety of composite laminated structures. This paper addresses the difficulty of detecting invisible damages induced by an impact in order to prevent structural failures. Composite flat plates were prepared for impact experiments, and acoustic emission signals were measured by fiber Bragg grating sensors. Firstly, the differences in signal characteristics in the intact and damaged cases were investigated. For intact cases, the waveform was symmetrical and the generated signal peaks were uniform. On the contrary, the signals of damaged cases were contaminated by emitted acoustic waves induced from damages. Through signal processing that identifies such differences, damages could be detected. Also, due to the influence of the AE signals from the damage that is generated between each lamina, the peaks tend to occur irregularly in the signal. It means that the number of peaks increased and frequent changes of path length between adjacent peaks occurred in the signals of damaged cases. By quantifying these phenomena, the induced damages were evaluated and validated from experimental results. This paper offers efficient and robust method for measuring delamination of laminated composites using the simple fiber optic sensing system.}
