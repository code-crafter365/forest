abstract = {The control of elastic waves in metamaterials has predominantly focused on beam and plate structures, with relatively limited research on cylindrical shell structures. However, cylindrical shell structures are used in various applications where elastic wave modulation plays a crucial role in vibration noise control and vibration energy research. Consequently, this paper achieves frequency conversion of elastic waves in cylindrical shell structures using piezoelectric metamaterials. The study demonstrates that elastic wave frequency conversion can be accomplished through a “single-sensor-dual-actuator” approach, conventional physical law of frequency is not variable can be break by frequency conversion. This work begins with theoretical derivation of the kinetic equation for cylindrical shell structures, along with design of piezoelectric metamaterial cylindrical shells and the development of time-dependent transfer functions. Then, elastic waves frequency conversion is thoroughly analyzed by simulation on axial and circumferential cylindrical shells, these analysis results are investigated and discussed. Finally, frequency conversion function is verified through experiments which are collecting elastic wave parameters in frequency domain. The experimental results align closely with the simulation outcomes, demonstrating that frequency conversion of incident elastic waves can be successfully achieved in the range of 7 kHz to 9 kHz. Moreover, frequency conversion with different values can be realized by modifying key parameters in the transfer function. This work provides a solid experimental foundation and methodology for achieving elastic waves frequency conversion in curved shell structure, contributing to the broader understanding and application of elastic wave metamaterials.}
