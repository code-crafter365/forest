abstract = {This paper presents a shell-based multiscale model for predicting the mechanical properties of through-thickness woven composites (TTWC) under in-plane and out-of-plane loadings, with capturing coupled damage evolution at the meso- and macroscale. A reduced shell scheme is employed for the macroscale, while full-thickness RVEs of TTWC are established at the mesoscale to account for inhomogeneous response along the thickness direction. The macro- and mesoscale simulation are coupled and executed simultaneously within a nonlinear concurrent framework. This approach enables the nonlinear macro-shell behavior, characterized by generalized strain and stress resultants, to be directly derived from the realistic mesoscale damage response. By incorporating scanned mesoscale geometries and damage constitutive relations, the shell-based multiscale model is applied to investigate damage and failure mechanisms in notched tensile and simply-supported bending plate samples, respectively. The predicted results are analyzed and compared with existing experimental data and direct numerical simulations (DNS), validating the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed model.}
