abstract = {Bistable composite column-shell structures are extensively employed in aerospace deployable systems, with curling being the primary method for storage and deployment. To streamline the FE (FE) modeling of the curling process and investigate the strength characteristics, this paper proposed a simplified finite element method (FEM) for bistable composite column-shell structures based on a reverse modeling approach. Firstly, based on the theory of the ploy region of the bistable column-shell structures, a reverse modeling method is proposed, which is capable of obtaining the geometrical configurations of the bistable column-shells under the fixed boundary conditions at one end. The accuracy of the reverse modeling result is verified by using the experimental method and the FEM. Then, based on the reverse modeling approach, a simplified FEM is developed, with both experimental and simulation results confirming its comparable accuracy to the traditional FEM. Finally, using this simplified FEM, the effects of ply angle and single-layer thickness on the structural strength during the curling process are analyzed, and guidelines for selecting optimal design parameters are provided.}
