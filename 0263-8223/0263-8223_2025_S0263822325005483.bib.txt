abstract = {This paper proposes a time-domain topology optimization method aimed at maximizing the energy-dissipation performance of viscoelastic composite materials while maintaining their structural stiffness. Viscoelastic materials are widely used for vibration damping in various engineering fields. However, materials with high damping characteristics typically exhibit low stiffness. To overcome this limitation and enhance the damping performance, a composite material that combines high-stiffness materials with viscoelastic materials, was designed. A time-domain topology optimization approach was employed to account for the interaction between the microstructural design of viscoelastic composites and the macroscopic structural behavior under time-dependent loading. This approach enabled the design of optimal microstructures tailored to specific macroscopic structural responses. The effective properties of the composites were determined based on the homogenization theory, and a systematic optimization framework was developed to achieve a balance between energy dissipation and stiffness in the macrostructures. The proposed method was validated through numerical examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of the optimal designs for enhancing the damping performance of viscoelastic composites.}
