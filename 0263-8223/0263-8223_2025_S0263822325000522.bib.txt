abstract = {The heterogeneous characteristics of composite materials are essential for understanding and predicting their mechanical behavior. Peridynamics (PD), grounded in integral equations, overcomes the singularity at the crack tip in classical continuum mechanics. However, it still lacks a clear theoretical description for handling weak discontinuities at interfaces. As an effective approach to handling interface problems, the phase-field method provides a solution for smooth interface transitions. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach that couples interface phase-field with peridynamics (IPF-PD). The interface phase-field order parameter is introduced into the peridynamics model. The approach enables interface diffusion and continuous material mechanical transition within the peridynamics framework. The effectiveness of IPF-PD model is verified through typical cases. The IPF-PD model’s material point discretization shows good convergence referenced to finite element solutions. Displacement field variation is analyzed using digital image correlation (DIC) tests on a bi-material plate under tension. The DIC analysis of bi-material plate shows a linear variation in the displacement field, with linear correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.84, respectively. The displacement gradients predicted by the coupling IPF-PD model are consistent with experimental results. Additionally, the accuracy of IPF-PD model in terms of damage mode, crack initiation, and propagation is further validated through a single circular reinforcement tension simulation. The interface detachment angle is simulated at 66.20°, which aligns with the theoretical value, indicating that the IPF-PD coupled model effectively captures the failure characteristics of heterogeneous materials. The interface phase-field and peridynamics (IPF-PD) coupling model offers a new approach to analyzing and predicting the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials.}
