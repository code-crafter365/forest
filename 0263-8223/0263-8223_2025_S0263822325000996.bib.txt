abstract = {Triple-layered woven lattice truss sandwich (TWLTS) composites that integrate multifunction of load bearing and sound absorbing were designed, fabricated, and tested for rail transit applications. Manufacturing of TWLTS involves vacuum infusion and co-curing processes to ensure high interfacial shear strength for delamination prevention. Three-point bending experiments were performed to investigate the failure mechanisms of TWLTS composites with varying core-layer configurations across different spans. Three-layered sandwich beam theory was proposed to predict the deformation. The impedance tube tests were conducted to acquire the sound absorbing performances. Compared with the single-layer WLTS, multilayer design improves the multifunction of load carrying and sound absorbing at the same time. For long-span beams, the initial and ultimate failure loads of asymmetric TWLTS composites are higher than those of symmetric structures. AS-285 exhibits high average sound absorption coefficients and excellent sound absorption performance than other structures. Varying the core-layer thickness offers potential opportunity for the multifunctional development of lightweight sandwich structures in rail transit system with outstanding load carrying and sound absorbing performances.}
