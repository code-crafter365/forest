abstract = {Among the current repair technologies for aircraft composite structures, scarfed repair with composite patches using vacuum bag curing technology is considered to be a repair method that takes both efficiency and reliability into account. During the molding process of composite material patches, process stresses arise in the patch. Determination of residual process stresses is a primary task for the modeling of the repair process. To achieve this objective, a numerical simulation framework is developed to model the curing deformation and residual stresses that arise in the scarf-repaired structure during the composite patch curing process. The framework incorporates the curing reaction, resin modulus variation, and volume changes during the repair process. Subsequently, the distribution of process-induced stress and deformation in repaired structures were analyzed. Finally, the effects of different heating rates and maximum curing temperatures on curing deformation and residual stresses were explored. The results showed that increasing the curing temperature and heating rate can shorten the repair time, but at the expense of increasing residual stresses in repaired structures.}
