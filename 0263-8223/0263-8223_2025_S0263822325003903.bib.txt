abstract = {Interpenetrating phase composites (IPC) are materials with two or more mutually continuous, interconnected phases. This structure allows each phase to retain its properties, while together they exhibit enhanced synergistic properties. In this work, polymer-metal IPCs with Triply Periodical Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures were fabricated and tested for their mechanical properties at different impact velocities (ranging from 0.1 mm/s to 250 m/s). Samples. The samples comprise a stainless steel reinforcement phase and two polymeric matrices (silicone and epoxy). Computed tomography was used to evaluate the internal structure and the fabrication quality. The results showed that the samples were thoroughly infiltrated with polymeric filler, achieving a high degree of homogeneity in the composite. The compression tests of silicone-filled IPCs showed an increase in stiffness. Still, the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) was not improved due to the non-optimal stiffness ratio between the polymeric matrix and the metallic reinforcement phase. However, using epoxy as the matrix resulted in the SEA enhancement of 38 %. This is attributed to the interlocking mechanism between the two phases, which improved the macroscopic mechanical properties. The compression tests showed significant strain rate hardening due to the base material’s strain rate sensitivity and the inertia effects.}
