abstract = {Electric aircraft is an important development direction in the future aviation field, which greatly reduces the emissions of carbon dioxide and exhaust gases, and is an important way to achieve green aviation. As a typical element of the electric aircraft, the composite airfoil beam structure often operate in hygrothermal environments, which can affect the dynamic performance of the aircraft. This paper provides a method for the vibration of composite laminated airfoil beam structures (CLABSs) under the effect of complex circumstance through systematic theoretical and experimental research. The kinetic, potential and hygrothermal energies of CLABSs induced by the hygrothermal environment are derived by using Kirchhoff theory. To simulate the coupling between plates and the elastic support, a set of uniformly distributed springs is introduced. By employing a set of modified orthogonal polynomials, the dynamic equation for CLABSs is derived within the framework of the Rayleigh approach. The validity of the proposed method is then verified by finite element analysis and experiments investigation. Furthermore, the discussion includes the vibration properties of CLABSs at varying connecting spring stiffnesses, hygrothermal circumstance, and some effective conclusions are drawn, which provide an effective computational method for the vibration analysis and optimization for composite airfoil beam structures.}
