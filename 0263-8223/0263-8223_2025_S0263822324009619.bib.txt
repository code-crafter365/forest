abstract = {During the drilling of thermoplastic carbon fiber reinforced polyetheretherkrtone (CF/PEEK), significant issues such as material smearing, burr formation, and delamination arise due to the softening and melting of the matrix material when exposed to heat. This study delves into the mechanisms of damage formation and evolution during the drilling of CF/PEEK using twist drills equipped with chip-split grooves and two-step step drills. Various factors such as drilling temperature, thrust force, chip morphology, and machined surface quality were meticulously examined to understand the material removal mechanisms. A three-dimensional defect factor, accounting for burr, tearing, and delamination, was employed to assess the overall hole quality. The utilization of chip-split grooves led to the formation of spiral chips, effectively preventing chip creasing and clogging, reducing drilling temperature. Comparatively, Twist drills exhibited a 62% increase in drilling forces but an 18% decrease in drilling temperatures compared to step drills. Furthermore, twist drills demonstrated a notable 57% reduction in burr and tear areas and a significant 69% decrease in delamination areas. Analyzing the distribution of delamination, the exit delamination associated with the step drills was found to be 19% smaller than the twist drills, while the entrance delamination area was five times larger.}
