abstract = {Metamaterials are widely studied due to their unconventional properties, which derive primarily from internal artificial structures rather than the properties that make up their substrate. As a kind of metamaterial, mechanical metamaterial refers to materials with special mechanical properties based on geometric microstructures, such as auxetic mechanical behavior, multistable state, adjustable stiffness, etc. Compared with traditional materials, mechanical metamaterials can be designed to achieve a variety of unique physical properties to meet the requirements of various fields. They usually have the characteristics of lightweight, high specific stiffness and strength, controllable Poisson’s ratio designable anisotropy, etc. They can meet the requirements of multiple functions while meeting the load-bearing performance. They can be used as structural support materials, energy absorption materials, noise reduction materials, thermal conductivity materials, and biological materials, and have broad application prospects in aviation, navigation, medicine, and etc. In this work, we reviewed the basic design ideas, deformation mechanism, and mechanical properties of mechanical metamaterials. The design principles and performance analysis methods of shape memory polymers (SMP) are emphasized. he key problems in the design and development of such materials and the future development trend are also discussed.}
