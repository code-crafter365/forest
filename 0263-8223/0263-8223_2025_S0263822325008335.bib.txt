abstract = {There is a need to enhance the efficiency of welding technology for high-performance CFRTPs, particularly for use in the primary structures of transportation vehicles. This study investigated the effect of preheating—considered a potentially effective approach—on the ultrasonic welding of CF/PEEK composite laminates. Weld quality was assessed using ultrasonic testing and X-ray CT with five different preheating temperatures (including room temperature) and three welding durations as experimental parameters. Additionally, the impact of preheating on mechanical performance was evaluated through short-beam tests under bending loads. A suitably elevated preheating temperature increased the weld area and improved the apparent interlaminar shear strength by approximately 20 MPa, representing an increase of about 44 % compared to room temperature conditions.}
