abstract = {In this paper, experimental results for fatigue damage growth behavior of a single-edge notched cross-ply laminate obtained using Digital Image Correlation (DIC), thermography, and supplemented by prior X-ray computed microtomography (mCT) data, are presented. These experimental results are used to develop a novel multi-scale fatigue life estimation model, whose details are reported elsewhere [1].}
