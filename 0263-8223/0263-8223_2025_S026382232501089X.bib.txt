abstract = {This study presents an integrated experimental and numerical investigation into the structural behavior of simple and prestressed laminated glass beams. An experimental program employing four-point bending tests on annealed laminated glass specimens, with and without high-carbon steel prestressing cables, was conducted to evaluate load–displacement response, failure mechanisms, and post-fracture performance. Prestressed beams demonstrated marked performance improvements, achieving 75–88 % greater load capacity (40–47 kN versus 20–25 kN) and enhanced deformation capacity (13–25 mm mid-span deflection at failure compared with 5–8 mm). A complementary finite element framework was developed, incorporating Concrete Damage Plasticity (CDP) and Johnson–Holmquist-2 (JH-2) models for glass, elastoplastic behavior for prestressing cables, and a combined hyperelastic–viscoelastic formulation for the SentryGlas® interlayer. Prestressing was successfully simulated using a thermal analogy technique, achieving the target compressive stress of 26.5 MPa. The CDP-based model accurately predicted fracture initiation (within 1 % of experimental values) and effectively captured the three-phase failure progression of prestressed specimens, while maintaining computational efficiency. In contrast, the JH-2 model, despite offering a robust parameter set and strong performance in compression- or impact-driven fracture scenarios, showed limitations in accurately reproducing the tension-driven cracking behavior characteristic of glass beams under bending. These findings confirm that prestressing transforms the inherently brittle response of glass into a more ductile, controlled failure process, significantly enhancing both serviceability and residual performance. The validated modeling framework, particularly when using the CDP approach, provides a practical and reliable tool for structural engineers, enabling the design and optimization of innovative prestressed glass systems that combine transparency with enhanced ductility and safety in structural applications.}
