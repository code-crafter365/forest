abstract = {This paper develops a partitioned three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction method to predict the flutter behaviors of honeycomb sandwich panels with curved-wall cores in supersonic airflow. An advanced analytical model is utilized to represent the curved-wall honeycomb structure. A higher-order shear deformation theory, which accounts for the zigzag effect, is employed for modeling the honeycomb sandwich panel. Nonlinear von Kármán strains are incorporated to consider the large deformations of the panel. The supersonic airflow is formulated by the finite volume method within an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework. The evolution of nonlinear flutter behaviors in honeycomb sandwich panels under varying dynamic pressures is investigated. The results indicate that the curvature radius and the ply-angle of the honeycomb layer exert differ influences on the flutter dynamic behaviors. The presence of curvature results in a reduced amplitude and an increased frequency of flutter, while altering the ply-angle results in both an increased amplitude and frequency. In addition, asymmetric flutter deflections associated with uneven pressure distributions are observed in honeycomb layers with positive ply-angles. These findings can serve as a basis for honeycomb structure optimal design.}
