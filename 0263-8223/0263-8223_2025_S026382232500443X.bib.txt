abstract = {Efficient energy absorption is paramount in engineering applications, especially from a protection point of view. Over the years, relentless efforts have been dedicated to designing and deploying lightweight high-performance energy absorbers for safety in transportation and to enhance fuel economy. It is well known that the multicellular thin-walled tubes render superior crashworthiness performance and stable deformation by virtue of unique material distribution in their geometry. In recent literature, a novel design philosophy of introducing hierarchy and the concept of fractals for energy absorption has emerged as an alternative to enhance the energy absorption capabilities and approach closer to an ideal force–displacement response. This review paper compiles the published work pertaining to hierarchical and fractal geometries, providing a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and developments. First, the structures are classified, then common manufacturing methods employed are discussed, and subsequently, the crashworthiness response obtained for these geometries is presented. Furthermore, the effect of key loading and geometrical parameters are described, followed by a detailed discussion of optimization techniques and results. Finally, the review concludes with an outline of challenges to be overcome and the avenues for further research to enhance crashworthiness have been suggested. The review aims to provide a comprehensive and informative overview of the research landscape in the niche of hierarchical and fractal energy absorption structures for crash applications.}
