abstract = {The Legendre polynomial approach commonly utilizes the rectangular window function to address the boundary conditions. When it comes to solving multi-layered structures, especially when considering imperfect interfaces, its solving procedure is extremely complicated and laborious. Therefore, an analytical integration method using Legendre polynomial expansion of boundary conditions is proposed. The control equations and boundary conditions are individually polynomially expanded separately to derive the characteristic systems. The influence of imperfect interfaces on dispersion curves, electromechanical coupling coefficients, phonon-phason coupling effect, non-local effect, and piezoelectric effect are investigated. In addition, a finite element model for waves in piezoelectric quasicrystal layered nano-plates is developed for the first time, whose results are highly convergent with those of the proposed polynomial method. The computational efficiency of the proposed Legendre polynomial method is over 99 % and 98 % higher than that of the available Legendre polynomial method and the finite element method, respectively. Some new cases are explored: The imperfect interfaces and phonon-phason coupling reduce the electromechanical coupling effect, while the non-local effect increases it. For phonon modes, imperfect interfaces suppress the piezoelectric effect while enhancing non-local and phonon-phason coupling effects. These basic studies can provide direction for the development of high-performance piezoelectric quasicrystal devices.}
