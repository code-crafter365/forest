abstract = {To provide a refined guide for the design and application of optimal crystalline cellular structures (OCCS), an in-depth investigation into the quasi-static and dynamic combined shear-compression behaviors of single-layer (Hp-structure) and double-layer (Hc-structure and T-structure) OCCS with varying relative densities (ρr) has been undertaken. First, the three structures of AlSi10Mg with a ρr of 25.84 % are manufactured via 3D printing. Then, a battery of quasi-static and dynamic pure compression tests is executed to elucidate the mechanical responses of these structures. Finally, a numerical study is used for exploring the influence of ρr on their quasi-static/dynamic combined shear-compression behaviors. The quasi-static/dynamic pure compression results show that, for different compression parameters (σpk,σpl, σm, EA, SEA), the optimal structural representatives (Hp-structure, Hc-structure, or T-structure) in different ρr ranges are identified. The dynamic compression deformation mechanisms and theoretical analyses of Hc-structure and T-structure are proposed. As shear angle increases, the shear-compression performance of Hp-structure significantly decreases, while those of Hc-structure and T-structure gradually decrease. Fitted quasi-static/dynamic initial yield envelopes are used to provide design criteria for OCCS.}
