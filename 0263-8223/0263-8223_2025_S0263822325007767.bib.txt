abstract = {This work presents an MFE2 homogenization framework for nearly incompressible, particle-reinforced composites undergoing finite viscoelastic deformations. The key feature of the framework is the simultaneous application of a reduced mixed finite element formulation at both the micro- and macro-scales, which eliminates volumetric locking without requiring static condensation. Moreover, the polymer matrix is modeled using a Yeoh-type hyperelastic energy function combined with a generalized Maxwell network to capture finite-strain viscoelastic behavior. The Hill–Mandel condition is used to derive energetically consistent transition conditions between scales. A key contribution is a novel formulation for the averaged microscopic stress, which rigorously yields a first elasticity tensor that preserves major symmetry. This formulation, coupled with the derivation of an algorithmically consistent tangent of the macroscopic problem for representative volume elements with periodic boundary conditions, ensures quadratic convergence and enables efficient solution of complex boundary value problems. The developed computational model is implemented in the finite element package Abaqus for numerical simulations of particulate nearly incompressible composites. Various convergence studies and structural benchmark problems presented in this study confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.}
