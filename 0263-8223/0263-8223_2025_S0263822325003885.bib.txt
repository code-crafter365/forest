abstract = {Three-dimensional braided composites (3DBC) are widely used in aerospace due to their excellent impact resistance and structural integrity. The excellent mechanical performance of 3DBC can be achieved by ensuring precise dimensions, stable structure and low-damage fabrication technology for the 3D braided preform. In this research work, we developed meso-scale and micro-scale finite element models to numerically analyze the damage and deformation behavior of braided structures during the fabrication process of 3D braided preform. The deformation and damage mechanism of fibers at different scales during 3D braiding process are first analyzed. The results show that stress always concentrates at the interlaced regions and is affected by the beating-up process. The outer yarns are more easily damaged during the braiding process. In the beating-up process, when the beater reaches the highest point, the first broken fiber is generated, and the broken fiber is located in the interlaced area. The damage caused by the beating-up motion is greater than that caused by fiber movement. The damage to the elements is mainly caused by shear stress. The greater the friction coefficient between fibers and the higher of the beating-up height, the more severe fiber deformation in the interlaced area. These results can provide valuable guidance for the fabrication of high-quality 3D braided preforms.}
