abstract = {3D lattice structure is a kind of advanced metamaterial structure with excellent performance, such as lightweight, high specific strength and stiffness, shock damping, heat dissipation, and electromagnetic shielding capabilities. With the development of additive manufacturing technology, it has been widely concerned and developed rapidly in recent years. In order to further integrate the performance of lattice structures with mesoscale units into multi-scale optimization, this paper proposes an optimization design method for the multi-scale TPMS (Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces) lattices based on geometric continuity fusion and strain energy driven. Regarding the challenge of geometric continuity problem of complex transition boundaries in multi-TPMS lattices, interface interpolation and density factor optimization methodologies are studied. At the same time, the mapping mechanism between lattice configuration and mechanical properties of multi-TPMS lattices is discussed in view of the requirements of multi-scale design from macro to micro configurations. Then, the multi-TPMS lattice density and configuration fields in the design domain are co-designed with the strain energy driven. Simulation and experimental results show that the mechanical properties of the multi-scale TPMS lattice designed by the proposed method are significantly improved compared with the traditional single-configuration gradient lattice, including the stiffness of the cantilever beam optimized structure is improved by 20.5% and the flexural stiffness of the three-point flexural beam optimized structure is improved by 51.3%.}
