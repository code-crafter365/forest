abstract = {R-curves of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates were obtained during transverse cracking using the size effect law of the fracture toughness specimens. The CFRP laminates were composed of high-modulus polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fibers and three different matrix resins. Since debonding between high-modulus PAN-based carbon fibers and matrix resin occurs at a lower applied stress, two modified resins were prepared to enhance their performance. Failure processes were observed in situ using a high-magnification optical microscopy system. This allowed for a correlation between the microscopic failure processes and the R-curves, providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of transverse cracking. Both the R-curves and microscopic failure processes were significantly influenced by the matrix resins. With the unmodified matrix resin, debonding between the carbon fibers and the matrix, as well as large deformation of the matrix resin in the debonded regions, was observed. In contrast, debonding was less pronounced with the modified matrix resins. A modified, flexible matrix resin exhibited ductile and cohesive failure, whereas a modified yet stiffer matrix resin resulted in brittle failure. These findings suggest that interfacial and resin properties, along with changes in stress states, contribute to the microscopic failure processes. This study provides a fundamental understanding of transverse cracking mechanisms at the microscale.}
