abstract = {This study investigates the Low-Velocity Impact (LVI) performance and recovery capabilities of thermoplastic glass fiber composite laminates reinforced with Nitinol Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires. The potential of SMA-reinforced composite plates to absorb energy, restore the after-impact deformations and mitigate the properties degradation has been evaluated under repeated low-energy strikes and heat-treatment cycles. Repeated LVI tests were conducted at three distinct energy levels, with both hybrid and non-hybrid control sample groups subjected to impact and effective thermal recovery cycles. It was revealed that this newly presented hybridization method followed by thermal healing cycles enhanced the laminates’ resistance, significantly increasing the perforation threshold number of impacts. Moreover, the SMA-assisted recovery process effectively reduced permanent dent deformation, achieving over 50 % healing in specific iterations.}
