abstract = {Wind turbine blades, designed as thin-walled hollow sections, are prone to compressive buckling, due to the Brazier effect caused by curvature that arises from flapwise bending deformations. To address this issue, this study proposes a beetle elytron-inspired trabecular core, consisting of thin-walled trabeculae with grid webs and chamfers, providing superior compressive performance compared to conventional web cores. However, the structural optimization for compressive strength (σu) of trabecular cores remains unexplored. Three dimensionless trabecular-related parameters, including the ratios of trabecular radius to cellular length (η), chamfer radius to trabecular radius (ξt) and core height to core thickness (β), were investigated through 32 sets of coupon tests, identifying local buckling as the preferred failure mode. The boundary condition, identified through a physical-data-driven hybrid modelling that combines the physical buckling mode with a data-driven regression model trained on experimental results, was incorporated into the development of optimization functions. Finally, the optimization results were validated using experimental data and numerical simulations, and applied to identify the optimal combination of trabecular-related parameters with various radius-to-thickness ratio (D) for the sectional design of trabecular cores in wind turbine blades.}
