abstract = {This work presents a design of intelligent structures for integrated composite laminate (ICL) with embedded MFCs. Considering the piezoelectric effect of MFCs, a semi-analytical dynamic model is established by combining the first-order shear deformation theory and the Lagrange equation. Furthermore, the preparation method of the ICL specimen with embedded MFCs is summarized, and an experimental system capable of active control testing is constructed. The maximum errors between the natural frequencies obtained by the semi-analytical method and those from finite element results and experimental results are 0.58% and 4.18%, respectively, and the vibration response results are in good agreement. Under the given control parameters, the vibration response after control is reduced by about 44.4%. The accuracy of the proposed modeling method and the effectiveness of the active control system are verified. Finally, the effects of fiber distribution and angle on the natural characteristics and damping performance of the structure are investigated, the influence law of skin thickness change on the active control effect is revealed, and the control performance of the active control system under complex excitation conditions is verified. The findings provide a new technical approach for vibration suppression of composite laminate structures.}
