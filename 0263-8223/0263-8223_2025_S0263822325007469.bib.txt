abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polyphenylene sulfide composite (CF/PPS), as a novel FRTP, exhibits temperature-dependent mechanical properties in its matrix. To address this, this study employs a cross-scale modeling approach combining experiments, simulations, and physics-informed neural networks to characterize the temperature-related plastic behavior of CF/PPS and establish a macroscopic mechanical performance prediction model. Key contributions include: 1) Development of a temperature-dependent constitutive model for PPS elastoplastic behavior incorporating progressive hardening and thermal softening, achieving precise identification of hardening parameters. 2) Establishment of an SC-Hill48 yield criterion suitable for CF/PPS, enabling homogenized mechanical behavior characterization and revealing the continuous variation of yield parameters with temperature. 3) Creation of a physics-informed neural network model that efficiently predicts the macroscopic elastoplastic mechanical properties of unidirectional CF/PPS from constituent parameters, with validity demonstrated through laminate tensile/drilling simulations and experiments. This research provides theoretical support and methodological references for modeling temperature-dependent mechanical behavior and engineering applications (e.g., drilling process optimization) of thermoplastic composites.}
