abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technology is a critical technique for ensuring the safe service of composite structures. In SHM of composite structures, the embedding methods, monitoring principles, and signal transmission approaches of sensors are the key factors determining the reliability of monitoring results. This paper summarizes and compares sensors applied in SHM of composites, including piezoelectric sensors, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors, Carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors, and MXene sensors. It analyzes the classification, working principles, suitable monitoring scenarios, and the latest research progress of different sensors. Additionally, the paper proposes suitable embedding methods for different structures and monitoring environments, summarizes the current limitations of different sensors applied to SHM of composites, and suggests improvement strategies based on the sensor’s own synthetic properties, distribution location, and monitoring techniques. Finally, it provides an outlook on the future development directions of sensor technology for composites.}
