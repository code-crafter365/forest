abstract = {The current demand for lightweight and high-strength materials in various engineering applications makes the understanding of the inherent uncertainties in composite behavior crucial. This paper introduces for the first time a comprehensive framework to study the effect on the structural performance of uncertainties related to potential variation in the mechanical properties of laminated fiber-reinforced composite materials. The new framework for stochastic modeling incorporates probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainties in material properties and their influence on damage progression. One of the advantages of the proposed methodology is the comparison of numerical results with experimental ones on a series of bending tests. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of uncertainty quantification into the analysis of composite materials can lead to more robust engineering solutions, identifying the uncertainty in the damage parameters and material properties,explaining variability in the experimental data sets.}
