abstract = {Auxetic metamaterials have garnered extensive attention over the past few decades due to their exceptional and superior mechanical properties. However, owing to their unique porous structure, it is challenging to ensure that structures possess strong energy absorption capabilities while exhibiting excellent auxetic characteristics. This study introduces a rotating triangular auxetic metamaterial (RTAM) by perforating traditional rigid rotating triangles. Quasi-static compression tests and numerical simulations are conducted on the new structure to investigate the effects of wall thickness and re-entrant angle of the triangular perforated plate on mechanical properties and Poisson’s ratio. The plateau stress and specific energy absorption (SEA) of RTAM are 4 and 10 times higher than that of traditional trichiral auxetic metamaterials (TCAM), respectively. With an increase in wall thickness, both plateau stress and SEA of the structure are improved significantly. As the re-entrant angle increases, the SEA of the structure initially decreases and then increases. RTAM achieves both lightweight structure and ideal mechanical performance, providing an approach for manufacturing lightweight and high-strength auxetic metamaterials, with significant potential applications in the field of energy absorption.}
