abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that multi-cell bi-tubular tubes exhibit superior energy absorption capacity when compared to multi-cell tubes. In order to further enhance the energy absorption capacity of multi-cell bi-tubular tubes, this paper proposes an asymmetric gradient hierarchical bi-hexagonal tube (AGBT), which draws inspiration from the microstructure of the impact region of shrimp chelipeds and asymmetrical tree-like fractal structures. The results show that, under equal wall thickness conditions, the specific energy absorption and crushing force efficiency of the proposed 3rd order asymmetric gradient hierarchical bi-hexagonal tube (AGBT-3) are respectively 1.82 and 1.47 times higher than those of the conventional bi-hexagonal tube. Furthermore, under equal mass conditions, the specific energy absorption and crushing force efficiency of AGBT-3 are enhanced by up to 21% and 27%, respectively, in comparison to 0th order asymmetric gradient hierarchical bi-hexagonal tube (AGBT-0). These findings establish a clear advantage of the proposed AGBT-3 over AGBT-0 in terms of crashworthiness. Additionally, this study also conducts a theoretical prediction of the mean crushing force of the proposed AGBT, based on the simplified super folding element theory, and observes a good agreement between the theoretical prediction and numerical results. The outcomes of this study will serve as a valuable reference for the design and optimization of novel lightweight thin-walled energy-absorbing structures.}
