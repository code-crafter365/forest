abstract = {In this study, the mechanical behavior of the basalt-polyethylene fiber-reinforced concrete (BPEFRC) attacked by chloride under impact loading was experimentally investigated. The failure mode, dynamic compressive strength, dynamic compressive toughness, and dynamic increase factor of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) specimens were analyzed by considering factors such as strain rates and polyethylene (PE) fiber volume fractions. Based on the modified Zhu-Wang-Tang (ZWT) constitutive model, considering the concrete damage, strain rate effect, and toughening effect, a damage factor was introduced to develop dynamic damage constitutive models for BPEFRC. The results indicated that BPEFRC exhibited superior impact resistance and deformation capacity. Under chloride attack, improvements were observed in dynamic compressive strength, toughness, and dynamic increase factor (DIF). BPEFRC exhibited better integrity after quasi-static and SHPB tests. For dynamic compressive strength, with a fixed BF volume fraction of 0.10 %, the optimal PE fiber volume fraction was 0.10 % at strain rates of 74–145 s−1 for 0–90 d. The optimal PE fiber volume fractions for dynamic peak and ultimate toughness were consistent, at 0.10 %. The developed dynamic damage constitutive model effectively reflects the impact resistance of BPEFRC and aligns well with the test results. The results help evaluate the impact resistance of BPEFRC after chloride attack.}
