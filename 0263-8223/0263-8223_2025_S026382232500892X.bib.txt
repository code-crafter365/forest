abstract = {Hierarchical structure design opens new paths for high-performance composite materials. While aluminum nitride (AlN) particle-doped composites demonstrate advantages in thermal conductivity and high stiffness/strength, the coupling between soft-phase multi-damping sources at different length scales and hard-phase-driven damping activation remains unexplored, limiting their specific damping performance design. This study proposes a multiscale design criterion and a bottom-up strategy for AlN hierarchical composites with high loss modulus. By integrating a vitrimer damping phase containing multiple damping sources with a particle-doped structure exhibiting deformation-driven damping excitation effects, the synergistic interactions across nano-, micro-, and meso-scales are established. Extensive experiments and simulations reveal the specific damping enhancement mechanisms, demonstrating that the AlN-hierarchical composite with multiscale architecture achieves an exceptional room-temperature loss modulus of 921 MPa, overcoming traditional performance trade-offs. This approach enables advanced applications in aerospace and electronics requiring integrated vibration/thermal management.}
