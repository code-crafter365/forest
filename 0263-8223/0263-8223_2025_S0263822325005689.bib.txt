abstract = {Directional lamellar Ti3Si(Al)C2/Al composites were fabricated by infiltration of molten Al in freeze casted Ti3Si(Al)C2 preforms. Infiltration by electron beam melting favored the breaking of oxide film on molten Al and reduction of the infiltration time (40 s) to control interface reactions. Doping Al in Ti3SiC2 preforms facilitated reactive wetting with Al matrix, which further halved the infiltration time and formed a compact interface. The composites consisted of Ti3Si(Al)C2, Al, TiAl3, and TiC, and in-situ formed TiAl3 improved the interface bonding. The internal diffusion of matrix Al led to TiAl3 formation along the lamellar direction, while the external diffusion of Ti damaged the lamellar structure of Ti3Si(Al)C2. Al doping promoted Ti3SiC2 decomposition and Ti external diffusion, causing a reduction of Ti3SiC2 volume fraction from 43 % to 15 % and tortuosity increase from 1.6 to 8.1. The composites fabricated via electron beam melting exhibited an average Young’s modulus of 95 GPa and hardness of 3.7 GPa, with these values increasing as the Al-doped content rose. While the maximum yield strength in compression of the composites, 370 MPa, was achieved at an Al doping content of 0.12, which was due to the contributions of the lamellar structure and TiAl3 formation.}
