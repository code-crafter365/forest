abstract = {Interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) structures utilize the interlocking and continuity between two phases, along with high damage tolerance, to effectively disperse and transfer stress. This results in significant improvements in the material’s strength, stiffness, and toughness. In this study, a method for calculating the equivalent modulus of IPC structures is proposed using principles of calculus combined with equal stress and equal strain assumptions. This approach provides theoretical support for the design of novel IPC structures. On this basis, the new lattice was generated by controlling implicit function inputs, and the complementary structure was obtained via Boolean operations to form the final IPC structure. Experimental and numerical analyses were conducted to compare key performance metrics and elucidate the synergistic mechanisms. The results indicate that the mechanical properties of the novel lattice and IPC structures have improved significantly, likely due to the presence of continuous regions of reinforcement phase parallel to the loading direction. These novel IPC structures promoted stretching-dominated deformation behavior, and the yield strength and energy absorption capacity under dynamic loading are increased by approximately 60 % and 25 %, respectively.}
