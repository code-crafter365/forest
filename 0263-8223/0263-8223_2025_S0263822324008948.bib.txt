abstract = {In this work, a newly numerical approach for the global and local analysis of laminated composite plates, incorporating size-dependent effects through refined zigzag kinematics and nonlocal strain gradient theory, is developed. By applying the principle of virtual displacement, we derive a weak form of the equilibrium equations based on the nonlocal strain gradient theory, resulting in a local continuum model. This model inherently accounts for deviations in stiffness due to material inhomogeneity and interatomic forces, particularly at small scales. The refined zigzag theory is used to model the displacement field of the plates, which is numerically approximated using the NURBS-based isogeometric analysis technique. This approach allows us to account for the size-dependent characteristics of the laminate at micro/nanoscale through higher-order nonlocal parameters and nonlocal gradient length coefficients. We validate the proposed model for static and free vibration analyses by comparing our numerical results with those reported in the literature. As an original contribution, this research extensively explores the size-dependent effects on the layerwise local responses of laminated composite plates under static loading conditions with various stacking sequences and thickness ratios being investigated.}
