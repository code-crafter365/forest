abstract = {The primary obstacle to enhancing the mechanical performance of CF/PEEK composites is the insufficient interfacial bonding strength and poor impregnation properties. The present study addresses this issue by focusing on the development of a highly heat-resistant and easily soluble poly (aryl ether ketone) (PFEEK) interfacial binder as well as a processing technology for chopped ultra-thin CF tapes. As a result, the CF/PEEK-2 composites (Mw: 12000 g/mol) exhibited optimal mechanical performance with interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), tensile strength, tensile modulus, tensile toughness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus of 86.0 MPa, 772.9 MPa, 50.2 GPa, 13.5 MJ/m3, 878.5 MPa, and 47.8 GPa, respectively, which can be attributed to the excellent impregnation properties and wettability of the CF bundles and PEEK matrix. Therefore, a heat-resistant (Tg > 250°C; Td5% > 485°C) and diffluent PFEEK binder will provide crucial guidance for further large-scale applications of high-end CF/PEEK composites.}
