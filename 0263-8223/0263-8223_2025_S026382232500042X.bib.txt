abstract = {A novel isogeometric analysis model for magneto-electro-elastic curved microbeams with continuously varying material composition accounting for size effect is proposed in this research based on the modified couple stress theory (MCST). Utilizing Hamilton’s principle, the governing equation of the composite curved microbeam is systematically derived. Spline basis functions are utilized to accurately represent the displacement fields, electric and magnetic potentials, and geometry for curved beams with constant and variable curvatures. The correctness and reliability of the newly proposed beam model are confirmed with rigorous convergence analysis. Detailed parametric investigations are conducted to examine the influence of beam size, gradient index, loading conditions and size effect on the mechanical and electro-magnetic response of MEEFG curved microbeam with different geometries. The findings indicate that size effect is crucial in modulating both bending and vibration responses of microstructures. The properties of functionally graded structures can be tailored by adjusting the gradient index, allowing for greater control over their performance. The novel numerical model provides a theoretical foundation for the application of complex-shaped micro-smart structures in advanced engineering fields such as micro-electro-mechanical systems, energy harvesting fields, micro-robotics and adaptive structures.}
