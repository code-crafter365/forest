abstract = {The spider orb web has evolved to efficiently absorb the energy of flying insects colliding with it. In this study, a novel three-dimensional lattice structure inspired by the specific structural characteristics of the spider orb web was designed and optimized to create a new lattice design. The design was optimized for energy absorption and energy absorption efficiency using a size optimization procedure with numerical modeling based on beam elements under quasi-static compression loading. This optimized lattice was additively manufactured and subjected to quasi-static compression testing. Numerical results for energy absorption and compression behavior showed good agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, numerical analysis of the optimized lattice was performed using solid elements to predict the energy absorption behavior more accurately, and the results showed even better agreement with experimental data. The resulting lattice also demonstrated improved energy absorption performance compared to existing lattice structures.}
