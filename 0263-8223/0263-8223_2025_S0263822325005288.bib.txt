abstract = {This paper presents a complex wavelet transform for damage detection in the stepped laminated composite beams. The mathematical model incorporates shear deformation, rotary inertia, warping, tension-bending-twisting coupling, and Poisson’s effect. It also accommodates step changes in thickness and width by modeling the beam as a series of sub-beams with constant cross-sections. The equations of motion are derived using continuity conditions at sub-beam interfaces and the finite element method. Validation is conducted through 3D finite element simulations in Abaqus and comparison with simplified cases from the literature, showing excellent agreement. To evaluate damage detection performance, both numerical and experimental analyses are carried out using the complex wavelet transform, which computes modulus and phase parameters. The results demonstrate that this method exhibits greater sensitivity to damage than continuous wavelet transform and derivative-based techniques, particularly via phase diagram analysis. Experimental tests confirm the effectiveness of the method in identifying damage locations with high accuracy. Among the wavelet functions considered, the Cgau3 wavelet proves to be the most suitable for detecting damage in the stepped laminated composite beams. These findings highlight the advantages of using complex wavelet analysis for enhanced structural health monitoring in composite beams.}
