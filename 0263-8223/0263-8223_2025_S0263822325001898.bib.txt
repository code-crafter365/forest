abstract = {This article investigated the interfacial strengthening of carbon fiber reinforced PEEK (CF/PEEK) by modifying CF with Al-substituted β-TCP (Al-TCP). Short carbon fibers with Al-TCP coating (CF/Al-TCP) were prepared using the electrodeposition process, and CF/Al-TCP/PEEK composites with 20 wt% CF/Al-TCP were then obtained by the solution method and the compression molding. The analysis of XRD, FTIR, TG-DSC, and SEM with EDS of CF/Al-TCP powders confirmed the success of the coating and its composition consisting of Ca9Al(PO4)7, β-TCP and AlPO4. Compared with bare CF (BCF), the contact angle with deionized water of CF/Al-TCP decreased by 14.2 %, and the surface energy of CF/Al-TCP increased by 16.2 %. Compared with BCF/PEEK, the flexural strength and flexural modulus of CF/Al-TCP/PEEK increased from 109 MPa and 5.129 GPa to 121.7 MPa and 5.182 GPa, respectively, with an increase of 11.6 % and 1.0 %. The predicted flexural modulus of CF/Al-TCP/PEEK composites using the finite element simulation method agreed well with the experimental results. The interfacial strengthening of CF/Al-TCP/PEEK can be explained by CF’s increased roughness (mechanical interlocking theory) and surface wettability (infiltration adsorption theory). These findings suggest that the CF/Al-TCP/PEEK composites can potentially be utilized for load-bearing orthopedic applications.}
