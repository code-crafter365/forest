abstract = {Recent advancements in additive manufacturing have spurred extensive research into triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattices for multifunctional applications, among which acoustic performance, particularly sound absorption, holds significant engineering relevance. Despite this interest, there are limited works that document the mathematical modelling of the acoustic properties of TPMS lattices and the various design modifications that improve their performance. In this work, we present a data-driven, multiscale analytical acoustics framework based on a refined Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Lafarge (JCAL) approach for modelling the sound absorption behaviour of both sheet-network and solid-network TPMS lattices. A comprehensive comparative analysis of several novel composite TPMS designs, including functionally graded relative densities, integration with micro-perforated panels, and hybridisation with strut or plate-based lattices, is also carried out, aided by our analytical model. All designs were then validated against experimental measurements on 3D-printed samples. Amongst the various strategies, overlaying TPMS lattices with resonant-based unit cells yielded the most substantial improvements in sound absorption across both magnitude and frequency ranges. This study offers valuable structure–property relationships and practical design guidelines for tuning the acoustic response of TPMS architectures and their derivatives. The resulting mathematical models are highly accurate, generalisable, and reusable, providing a robust foundation for the design and optimisation of lightweight, high-performance lattice-based acoustic materials for targeted applications.}
