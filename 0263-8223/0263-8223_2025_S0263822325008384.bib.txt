abstract = {Pultruded fiber-reinforced polymer (PFRP) composites have recently garnered significant attention for truss structures. However, the low connection efficiency and inherent brittleness of traditional PFRP profiles, with mostly unidirectional (UD) reinforcement, pose critical challenges that limit their structural applications. This study presents experimental and numerical investigations about the tensile performance of bolted sleeved joints between PFRP box profiles with multi-directional (MD) fiber layups, aiming to explore effective strategies for enhancing joint connection efficiency. The studied parameters included bolt layout, fiber layup, end distance and bolt spacing. Results indicate that the incorporation of MD fiber layups can improve the joint strength of the bolted sleeved joints by 90 %. Moreover, arranging the bolts to pass through all four walls of the box profile mitigated the uneven load distribution among bolts, thereby improving connection efficiency without requiring additional bolts or increased connection length compared to joints where bolts were arranged passing only through two walls. Increasing bolt spacing proved more effective in enhancing ultimate load than adjusting end distance. For engineering applications, it is recommended that bolt spacing exceeds five times the bolt diameter in order to guarantee pin-bearing failure.}
