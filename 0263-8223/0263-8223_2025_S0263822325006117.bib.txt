abstract = {This study investigates the behavior of unidirectional carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminates under multiple medium-speed, medium-energy multi-site impacts, focusing on both simultaneous and sequential loading scenarios. A specialized compressed air multi-cannon system was developed to perform controlled multi-impact experiments, replicating real-service conditions such as impacts from hail, gravel or foreign object debris. The experimental setup enables precise control over key parameters, including the number and location of impacts, time delays, velocities, and impact energies. A comparative analysis was also conducted between multi-site impacts and single impacts to assess the relative severity of damage. The results indicate that simultaneous impacts are more critical than sequential impacts due to intensified stress wave interactions and localized damage with greater instantaneous energy dissipation. However, single impacts remain the most critical configuration, producing greater damage in terms of both delamination and material failure. These findings provide valuable insights into the structural integrity of composite laminates and their response to complex impact scenarios. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding impact configuration effects to optimize material design and improve durability for aerospace, automotive, and defense applications.}
