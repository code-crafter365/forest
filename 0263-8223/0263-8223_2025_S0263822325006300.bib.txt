abstract = {Compact tension (CT) tests are widely used to evaluate the fracture toughness of composite materials. However, due to the complex geometry and material orthotropy, analytical solutions for composite CT specimens, particularly those with large-scale damage zones, are limited. This paper introduces an analytical weight function method (WFM) to characterize the fracture behavior of orthotropic composite CT specimens. The weight functions for orthotropic CT specimens are derived, and the influence of material orthotropy on these functions is quantitatively assessed. The determined weight function is then used to calculate stress intensity factors (SIFs) and crack opening displacements (CODs), showing excellent agreement with results from finite element (FE) analyses and existing literature. Additionally, the cohesive zone model (CZM) of composite CT specimens is analytically solved using the proposed WFM. The load–displacement relationship of the composite CT specimen is derived and further verified through FE analysis. Using the WFM, the SIFs, CODs, and crack propagation behaviors of orthotropic CT specimens can be accurately and efficiently determined.}
