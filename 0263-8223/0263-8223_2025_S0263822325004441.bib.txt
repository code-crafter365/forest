abstract = {Variable stiffness laminates can achieve outstanding strength through tailoring the steered fiber paths in each layer. However, much existing research focuses on optimizing laminates with symmetric and balanced layups. In this work, we proposed a strength optimization approach to tailor laminates with asymmetric layups to alleviate stress concentration effectively, considering their tension–bending, tension–torque and bending–torque coupling effects. In the meanwhile, manufacturing defects (i.e. gap-overlap defects) are addressed in the optimization by imposing both curvature and alignment constraints on the fiber paths. First, the coupling deformation effects are modeled in both the constitutive property and FEM model to fully explore their potential on strength enhancement. Then, a strain-based strength approximation from Tsai–Wu failure criterion is adopted for asymmetric laminates, where the fiber angles are taken as the design variables in the optimization. Lastly, an alignment constraint is developed, which is imposed in conjunction with curvature constraints in the strength optimization to limit gap-overlap defects. Numerical tests are executed to validate that our proposed alignment constraints can generate manufacturable variable paths. Additionally, our proposed method is shown to be capable of improving strength by a maximum of 56.7% in a beam plate model for UAV wing with multiple cut-outs using asymmetric laminates.}
