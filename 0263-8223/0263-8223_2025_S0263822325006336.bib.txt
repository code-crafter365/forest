abstract = {The classical micropolar peridynamic model (MP-PD) has shortcomings in capturing the deformation and damage of brittle 2D orthotropic materials, particularly under off-axis loading. This paper proposed an improved micropolar peridynamic model based on Timoshenko beam theory for brittle 2D orthotropic material. The micro stiffness matrix has been derived by employing energy equivalence principle. The stiffness and strength of micropolar bond in this model, including axial tensile, transverse shear and bending, are all the continuous functions depending on bond orientation, which facilitates deformation and fracture analysis of anisotropic materials with random orientations. Meanwhile, a new GPU parallel scheme has been employed to significantly accelerate the simulation process. The elastic and fracture behavior of the model has been validated by simulating the uniaxial stretch and shear of a lamina, fracture energy verification for different fracture modes, and the fracture of a cortical bone compact tension specimen, with quantitative comparisons made to analytical and experimental data. Furthermore, the proposed model’s capabilities for handling damage problems of brittle heterogeneous materials were demonstrated by simulating the dynamic fracture of a polycrystalline microstructure (Al2O3).}
