abstract = {The paper investigates the change of the structural dynamic behavior caused by embedding dry carbon fibers into beam-shaped specimens. It was assumed that a significant part of the vibration energy is dissipated due to friction between the dry fibers. To verify this, and to separate the effects of mass and stiffness changes, three different types of specimens – with and without dry fibers – were designed, manufactured and dynamically characterized through a bending resonance test. The results show a significant increase in damping due to the embedding of dry carbon fibers. Contrary to expectations, the natural frequency of this type of specimen increased along with the damping. However, the reason for this increase in damping and natural frequency remains unclear, as the decay curves, for example, do not exhibit a friction-typical characteristic.}
