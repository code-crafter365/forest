abstract = {The first part of this paper presents an experimental study about the fire behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in shear using carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) or steel bars embedded through-section (ETS technique) with different inclinations (90°/45°). The beams were simultaneously loaded in a three-point bending configuration and exposed to the ISO834 fire curve. The results showed that (i) the mechanical contribution of the 90°-CFRP bars was lost after 12 min of fire exposure, (ii) the fire resistance of the ETS system increased to 19 min when using 45°-CFRP bars, and (iii) the fire resistance of the ETS system increased to 48 min when using 90°-steel bars. The second part of the paper presents three-dimensional finite-element thermal models developed to assess the influence of adopting different fire protection systems on the fire resistance of ETS systems. The results showed that with 90°-CFRP bars it is possible to attain a (predicted) fire resistance of 121 min when applying U-shaped fire protection with thicknesses of 24 mm and 48 mm, respectively at the beam’s side and bottom faces. For 90°-steel bars, the (predicted) fire resistance attained 140 min when applying U-shaped fire protection with a constant thickness of 12 mm.}
