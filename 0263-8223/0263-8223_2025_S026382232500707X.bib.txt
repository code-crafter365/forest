abstract = {This work examines the effect of pores on mode I delamination in plain woven ceramic matrix composite (CMC) in the presence of process-induced porosity under a double cantilever beam (DCB) test. A cohesive zone modeling (CZM) approach within a finite element (FE) numerical framework has been used to simulate mode I crack growth. Pore distributions along the crack path have been explicitly modeled at varying porosities between 10%–30%, varying pore geometry, orientation, and location. A Monte Carlo simulation approach has been used to generate reaction load-displacement plots and resistance curves (R-curves) for the stochastic porous distribution within the FE-CZM numerical approach. A subset of the FE-CZM results is used to train a long-short-term memory (LSTM) machine learning (ML) model that considers the pore parameters as variables. The trained ML model is then used to predict reaction load-displacement plots for the remaining porous microstructures, yielding a fairly good match with a considerable speed up in run time. In addition to rapidly predicting material behavior when given a specific pore distribution, the ML model quantifies the impact of different pore parameters, such as size and location, on mode I delamination behavior in woven CMCs.}
