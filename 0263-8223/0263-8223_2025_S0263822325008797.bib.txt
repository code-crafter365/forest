abstract = {This study establishes a novel analytical model for blast response prediction in auxetic and regular honeycomb sandwich beams (AHSBs and RHSBs). The model advances blast analysis by integrating the core’s compressive dynamic strength, explicitly addressing auxetic negative Poisson’s ratio effects. A refined average compressive strain formulation captures core deformation non-uniformity. This framework accurately quantifies maximum deflection and energy absorption. Validation used experimental deflection data and numerical energy results. Results show significant blast performance superiority of AHSBs versus size-matched RHSBs. At 0.7971 m/kg1/3 scaled distance, deflections reduced by 20 % with 10.47 % higher energy absorption. At 0.8617 m/kg1/3, deflections lowered 11.41 % with 42.39 % greater energy absorption. The performance enhancement stems from auxetic cores’ greater average compressive strain. NSGA-II optimization applied to this validated model generated HSB designs maximizing specific energy absorption while minimizing deflection.}
