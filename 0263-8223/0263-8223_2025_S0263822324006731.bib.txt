abstract = {Composite materials provide greater freedom to tailor load-dependent deformations in lifting surfaces for improved hydrostructural efficiency across the operating envelope compared to metallic counterparts. For foils operating at high speeds, the trade-off between minimizing drag and avoiding cavitation and structural failure is a critical design challenge. This work optimizes cambered and symmetric marine composite appendages for maximum lift-to-drag while avoiding cavitation and structural failure across their operating envelopes. We use gradient-based optimization methods to optimize composite hydrofoils by varying nearly 100 design variables that parametrize planform, shape, and material layups. We compare the trends between optimal cambered and symmetric hydrofoil designs. We also compare our optimized composite hydrofoils to aluminum hydrofoil benchmarks that use extrusions of existing profiles (E1127 and E836) to illustrate the proposed benefits of the design approach. Both our cambered and symmetric optimized foils reduced the weighted drag and increased cavitation inception speeds compared to their corresponding benchmark foils while satisfying structural constraints. The customized stack of spanwise profiles in both optimal foils are shaped to achieve “rooftop” pressure distributions to avoid cavitation. Ply fiber angles also differ between optimized designs because of the relative importance of tip deflection and material failure constraints resulting from different peak design loads. Similar planforms between the optimized hydrofoils support the conclusion that, when nonzero lift coefficients exist in the operating envelope, backward sweep and nonlinear chord distributions reduce drag, delay cavitation, and help satisfy structural constraints. This work focuses on marine appendage design considering viscous flow and material anisotropy, but the proposed methods are generally applicable to the design of any lifting surface.}
