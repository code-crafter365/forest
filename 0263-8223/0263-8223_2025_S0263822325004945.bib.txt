abstract = {This paper presents a refined two-dimensional model, based on higher-order theories, for the hygro-thermo-magneto-mechanical analysis of doubly-curved laminated shell structures. The formulation employs a generalized kinematic model with zigzag functions, and it uses curvilinear principal coordinates to describe the geometry of the panel. The model allows us to assess arbitrary values of the multifield unknown variables, due to their description by using the Equivalent-Layer-Wise approach. The multifield analysis considers the coupling between various physical effects, including hygro-thermal, piezomagnetic, pyromagnetic, and hygro-magnetic constitutive interactions. The panel rests on an elastic foundation modelled with the Winkler-Pasternak theory. Furthermore, each layer is homogenized with proper analytical expressions and it is treated as a continuum material. The fundamental equations are solved analytically using the Navier method, while a recovery procedure based on three-dimensional balance equations reconstructs the multifield primary and secondary variable distribution in the post-processing stage. The method adopts the generalized differential and integral quadrature to solve the equations. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the theory compared to more computationally demanding three-dimensional solutions obtained with a commercial finite element software. Furthermore, parametric studies explore the sensitivity of governing parameters, considering various curvatures and lamination schemes, load shapes, and load combinations. The model serves as a useful tool for investigating the multifield response of curved laminates with simplicity and less computational effort. It can be used for exploring new insights into the multifield coupling effects that are not considered in commonly used software for multifield analysis.}
