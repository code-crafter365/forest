abstract = {The prime ambition of the current exploration is to signify the consequence of surface elasticity together with the nonlocality on the thermal induced asymmetric nonlinear buckling aspects of reinforced functionally graded (FG) porous arches at nanoscale dominated by dissimilar end conditions. The reinforced FG porous nano-arches are subjected to a concentrated load at different locations in conjunction with a thermal surrounding. In this regard, the Gurtin-Murdoch theory (GMT) besides the nonlocal theory (NT) of continuum elasticity are recruited within the exponential shear bendable curved beam formulations to embrace the consequences of the surface Lame parameters along with the surface residual and nonlocal stresses. In order to track down the unified GMT + NT elastic-based nonlinear equilibrium plots attributed to the asymmetric nonlinear buckling of FG porous nano-arches, the isogeometric type of numerical technique is engaged encompassing the knot insertion together with the knot multiplication peculiarities. It is released that for a nano-arch with smaller thickness, the effect of GMT of elasticity embellishes more appreciable, and the quantities of concentrated mechanical loads allocated to all introduced critical points intensify. However, by taking the unified GMT + NT elastic-based model into account, due to the softening consequence of the nonlocality, the role of GMT of elasticity reduces, even for a very thick nano-arch, an opposite feature is observed. Also, it is extrapolated that increasing the temperature does not affect the number of limit points. However, the influence of size dependencies in the both GMT elastic-based and unified GMT + NT elastic-based concentrated mechanical loads at the introduced critical points seems to become more pronounced after inducing the temperature rise.}
