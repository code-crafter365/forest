abstract = {Developing analytical models for structures with multiple interactions–such as a ring interacting internally with spokes and externally with a contact surface–is critical for the design of meta-wheels and the accurate quantification of contact pressure and load distribution. However, constructing such models is challenging due to the mathematical complexity involved in capturing these coupled interactions, and consequently, only a few analytical frameworks currently exist. This study introduces an analytical contact model for laminated composite rings in meta-wheels, incorporating both material anisotropy and foundation nonreciprocity. The model evaluates the deformation of a laminated ring supported by a nonreciprocal elastic foundation, employing a contact algorithm based on the integration of point loads. The proposed dual-interaction model enables comprehensive analysis of contact behavior and top-loading ratio as functions of ring geometry, laminate layup, material anisotropy, and the compression-to-tension stiffness ratio of the foundation. Results reveal that reducing this stiffness ratio significantly lowers contact pressure while enhancing load-bearing performance. The framework provides valuable physical insights and serves as an efficient inverse design tool for developing nonreciprocal spoke systems in meta-wheels, enabling the systematic optimization of structural performance.}
