abstract = {External wrapping of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) for the repair of steel pipes with slot-type defects has gained increasing acceptance. Interface debonding between the CFRP and the steel pipe is a common failure mode in this repair system, yet the fracture mechanism remains poorly understood. This paper presents an experimental and theoretical study aiming to elucidate the failure mechanism. A new bonded joint was designed for the experiment, and the debonding process was monitored by the strain distribution of the CFRP using distributed optical fiber sensors (DOFS). Stick-slip fracture behavior was observed in joints bonded with high-strength structural adhesives. Based on the experimental results, theoretical models are developed to describe the debonding process in three stages: elastic stage, rapid crack propagation (RCP) stage, and steady-state crack propagation (SSCP) stage. Using a linear elastic-brittle traction-separation relation, the interface debonding during the elastic and RCP stages is characterized by mode I dominated fracture, analyzed using a cohesive zone model. Mixed mode I-II fracture during the SSCP stage is analyzed using Griffith theory of fracture, with partitioning of the total energy release rate into its mode I and mode II components. The theoretical model aligns well with the experimental results, validating the model’s accuracy.}
