abstract = {Frequency-selective-rasorber (FSR) radomes have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in transmitting and absorbing electromagnetic waves. However, with an increase in aircraft flight speeds, FSR radomes struggle to withstand the high-temperature environments generated during flights. Meanwhile, traditional high-temperature frequency-selective-surface (FSS) radomes will fail in stealth against multi-base station radar detection systems. To address these challenges, this paper presents the innovative development of a high-temperature resistant integrated casting quartz fiber matrix. A topological pattern and slit square ring pattern were integrated using an enhanced genetic algorithm, resulting in a transmittance above 70 % within the range of 1.67–2.19 GHz at a thickness of 4.6 mm; its absorptivity within the range of 9.25–18 GHz exceeded 90 %. Notably, the absorption bandwidth of 11 GHz (>80 %) and the passband bandwidth of 2.38 GHz (>50 %) at 700 °C were achieved, leading to the development of a thin FSR that integrates high-temperature resistance, absorption, and transmission. Consequently,this study creates avenues for the integration of military communication and stealth technology, presenting a promising application prospect for the development of new stealth radomes.}
