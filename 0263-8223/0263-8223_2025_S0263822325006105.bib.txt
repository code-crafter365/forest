abstract = {The development of linerless liquid hydrogen composite tanks is a major challenge for improving the performance and cost of zero-emission commercial aircraft. Since tightness must be provided by the composite itself, an in-depth understanding of damage mechanisms in laminated composites at cryogenic temperatures is required. It is well accepted that environmental conditioning can affect the performance of composite structures, in particular water ingress. It is unclear, however, especially at cryogenic temperatures, whether water absorbed during manufacture or operations leads to additional damage. The present study therefore aims to highlight and understandthe effect of water absorption on transverse cracking in two laminated carbon fibre reinforced composite materials at cold and cryogenic temperatures. The results indicate that water absorption has a detrimental effect on transverse cracking in both materials and at all temperatures studied (−130 °C and −196 °C). The severity of these effects was seen to be linked to the affinity of the matrix and fibre/matrix interfaces with water, namely the amount of water absorbed by the system in a given environment. Finally, both reversible and irreversible absorption processes have been shown to contribute to the detrimental effects.}
