abstract = {SiCf/SiC ceramic matrix composites with excellent thermal stability, light weight and oxidation resistance have become key components in advanced aircraft engines. Nanofluid minimal quantity lubrication (NMQL) exhibits significant potential in enhancing heat transfer and lubrication efficiency during the grinding process. The technological challenge lies in thoroughly investigating the theoretical variation rule of grinding force, assisted by nanofluid minimal quantity lubrication, and subsequently achieving low-damage machining of SiCf/SiC composites. In this study, a prediction model for the grinding force during NMQL-assisted grinding was established, integrating diverse lubrication methods, grinding wheel geometric parameters, wear degree, process parameters, the anisotropy and damage degree of SiCf/SiC composites. The model was subsequently experimentally validated through grinding tests conducted on SiCf/SiC composites under various conditions, including dry grinding (DG), flood grinding (FG), minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), and carbon nanotube nanofluids (NMQL-CNTs), across multiple grinding depths. The present investigation’s grinding force forecasting model is evidenced to possess high accuracy of precision, showcasing mean deviations of 6.64 % and 11.97 % in the perpendicular (Fn) and tangential (Ft) grinding force components, respectively. Additionally, employing NMQL-CNTs facilitates the achievement of minimal grinding force and surface finish quality. At depths of 0.4 mm and 0.6 mm during grinding, the mean Fn magnitudes under the NMQL-CNTs lubrication approach underwent a decrease of 66.7 % and 74.5 %, respectively, in contrast, the mean Ft magnitudes experienced a reduction of 55 % and 67.2 %, correspondingly, in comparison to the DG lubrication technique. Notwithstanding the consistency in the material’s brittle removal mechanism across varying lubrication strategies, the NMQL-CNTs approach effectively alleviates fiber abrasion. Concisely, the research presented herein provides foundational theoretical insights and practical technological assistance for the achievement of low damage SiCf/SiC composite processing.}
