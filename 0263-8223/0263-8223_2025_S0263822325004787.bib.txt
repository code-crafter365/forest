abstract = {Numerical investigations were conducted to explore the mechanical response of hybrid layered continuous–discontinuous tape composites focusing on damage initiation and ultimate strength under both tensile and bending loads. These composites combine layers of continuous unidirectional tapes with layers of randomly oriented short (discontinuous) tapes. A series of laminated specimens was analyzed, representing various strategies to create hybrid combinations as well as the limit cases of pure continuous and pure discontinuous tapes. The hybrid architectures consist of different stacking sequences and varying ratios of continuous and discontinuous plies. Detailed mesoscale simulations were performed utilizing a finite element model that explicitly incorporates the ply-level arrangements of both continuous and discontinuous plies. By means of numerical homogenization, the effective elastic stiffness and strength of each configuration were determined, enabling the establishment of scaling laws for these properties with respect to spatial variability and the ratio of continuous to discontinuous tape content. These findings serve as a roadmap for optimizing the blend of these two types of tape to meet specific mechanical performance targets, thereby advancing the development of more sustainable and high-performing composites.}
