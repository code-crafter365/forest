abstract = {Thermal structures research has emerged as an important interdisciplinary field, involving heat transfer mechanisms, thermal protection systems, thermo-mechanical coupling phenomena, thermal energy storage technologies, and thermal management solutions across aerospace, electronic systems, and construction engineering applications. This comprehensive review systematically examines recent advancements in three key areas: (1) innovative heat-resistance material development, (2) advanced thermal structure designs, and (3) fundamental thermo-mechanical coupling mechanisms. The analysis specifically focuses on three representative material systems, demonstrating exceptional thermal performance: (1) functionally graded materials (FGMs) with spatially tailored properties, (2) hierarchically porous materials, and (3) next-generation reinforced composite materials. Furthermore, this review explores how geometric parameters of sandwich structure cores, including corrugated configurations, lattice topologies, and honeycomb geometries, significantly influence thermal conduction pathways and heat dissipation capabilities. From theoretical perspectives, this review introduces important theoretical analytical methods that examine the impact of temperature changes on the thermo-mechanical coupling behavior of structures. The differences between thermo-mechanical semi-coupled analysis and thermo-mechanical fully coupled analysis are also highlighted. This review emphasizes the importance of materials, structural designs, and analysis in engineering applications of thermal structures.}
