abstract = {This research endeavour investigates the enhancement of flame retardancy in natural fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites through boron-based cross-linking. Jute-sisal fabric was treated with borax and subsequently incorporated into a polypropylene matrix to develop flame-retardant composites. The borax-treated fabric exhibited significantly improved flame resistance, as evidenced by a 25.28% increase in limiting oxygen index (LOI), a 60.16% reduction in peak heat release rate (pHRR), and a 3.59% decrease in average heat release rate (av-HRR) compared to the untreated fabric. Similarly, the developed composites demonstrated enhanced thermal stability and flame retardancy, with a 22.01% increase in LOI, a 22.29% reduction in pHRR, and a 22.23% decrease in av-HRR compared to composites reinforced with untreated fibers. The dimensional thermal stability (DTS) of the composites assessed by heat deflection temperature and coefficient of thermal expansion was also improved with the incorporation of borax-modified fibers. Chemical and morphological analysis of the char residues of the treated fibers revealed a compact fibrous structure, which likely contributes to the enhanced flame retardancy by forming a protective char layer that insulates the underlying material and hinders heat and mass transfer.}
