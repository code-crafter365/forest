abstract = {This paper introduces an advanced self-sensing technique for two-dimensional carbon fibre textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) under monotonic tensile loading to monitor cracking behaviour, textile-matrix bond performance, fibre slippage, and cover spalling. The study employs single-sensor and multiple-sensor techniques to capture both global and local TRC behaviours, including crack quantification and location. It examines the conductive mechanism and evaluates piezoresistive performance in elastic and post-elastic regimes. Results demonstrated that the single-sensor technique provided comprehensive monitoring, while the multi-sensor approach improved crack detection. The conductive mechanism, driven by the carbon fibre network, exhibited dynamic changes with mechanical deformation, with the fractional change in measured resistance (ΔR/RO) varying based on reinforcement orientation. Optimal performance was associated with higher-quality matrices and specific reinforcement orientations. The ΔR/RO behaviour was linear within the elastic regime until the first crack, with significant drops at each crack location and exponential decay in the post-elastic regime. In the crack widening and failure stages, the ΔR/RO plateaued and exhibited partially reversible behaviour, indicating plastic deformations. The extent of the ΔR/RO drop was correlated with the degree of debonding at the sensor terminals. This work offered an effective technique for TRC monitoring and laid a foundation for future research in this area.}
