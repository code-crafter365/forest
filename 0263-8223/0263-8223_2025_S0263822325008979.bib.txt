abstract = {Recently, soft and lightweight impact-resistant protective materials have gained increasing attention. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reverse the traditional stacking sequence of fibers and elastomers. A sandwich-structured PBK composite material with an inverted stacking sequence of “polydiborosiloxane (PDBS)/modified woven basalt fiber (BK)/polydiborosiloxane” was developed, aiming to achieve excellent impact resistance in thin materials. The low-velocity drop ball impact tests show that the PBK with a thickness of 1 mm (PBK-1) can effectively attenuate the impact force under the impact height of 50–80 cm, with attenuation rates ranging from 95 %-97 %, demonstrating excellent energy dissipation capacity. The buffering time of PBK-1 is six times that of 1 mm thick basalt fiber. The mechanism is that as the impact height and strain rate increase, PBK-1 with a higher network activation energy exhibits a synergistic interaction between the unique dynamic B-O bonds in the PDBS outer layers and the tortuous regions within the woven BK core layer, enabling efficient energy absorption and release. Additionally, PBK-1 demonstrated good protective performance in the protection test of brittle bone samples. This novel thin sandwich composite material with excellent anti-impact, fabricated through a reverse stacking process, displaying a huge application potential.}
