abstract = {This study comprehensively investigates the elastoplastic responses and shakedown behaviors of FG hollow spheres subjected to monotonic and cyclic loadings. Based on radially graded power-law distributions of elastic modulus and yield strength, an analytical framework is established based on power-law distributions of elastic modulus and yield strength along the radial direction, which quantifies stress field patterns, plastic zone progression, and loading bearing capacities. This work reveals three characteristic elastic stress distribution patterns, dictated by gradient parameters and linked to distinct elastic limits. Crucially, these patterns govern plastic zone nucleation, which may initiate at the inner surface, outer surface, or intermediate region. All cases ultimately converge into two configurations: plastic-elastic or elastic–plastic from inner to outer surfaces, both reaching a unified fully plastic limit. Furthermore, based on Melan’s theorem, the first dedicated shakedown criterion for FG hollow spheres is established, accurately predicting distinct cyclic responses: shakedown, ratcheting, and alternating plasticity. In addition, finite element simulations with graded material properties validate the theoretical framework with negligible deviation in loading prediction, demonstrating rigorous computational analytical concordance. This framework systematically clarifies gradient parameter control of stress distribution, failure mechanisms, and cyclic stabilization, providing essential design guidelines for FG hollow spheres.}
