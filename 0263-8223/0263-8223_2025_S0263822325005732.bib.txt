abstract = {Understanding material behavior under varying stress and strain rates is key to improving design integration and reliability in critical sectors like defense and manufacturing. An innovative multi-dimensional honeycomb array gradient flyer (HAGF) is introduced to enable precise control over stress–strain rates, representing a significant advancement in material design. For the first time, LS-DYNA simulations uncover the detailed mechanisms of shock wave propagation, attenuation, and convergence by adjusting element numbers and spacing. Based on the proposed shock wave propagation mechanism, a multi-dimensional graded structure was designed and fabricated using projection microstereolithography (PμSL) with controlled polymerization, resulting in a defect-free structure with a tip size of 41.2 μm–67.5 % smaller than previous designs. This innovation enables controlled loading within low-stress (GPa) and strain-rate (104–105/s) ranges, providing a novel methodology for evaluating material dynamic responses in extreme environments. These findings provide a new technical foundation for improving material performance in demanding applications.}
