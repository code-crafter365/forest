abstract = {The present study investigates delamination damage initiation and propagation within a homogenization theory of mixtures, using the concept of virtual layers and virtual interfaces. It eliminates spatial discretization of layers, introducing a resultant damage variable to capture structure’s bulk response under both monotonic and cyclic loads. Fatigue-induced deterioration is classified into sub-critical, critical, and over-critical stages based on interfacial stresses. Calibration is conducted employing the widely-available Wöhler curves for each loading mode independently. An advance-in-time strategy is included in the model to enhance the simulation speed. The reliability of the approach is assessed for crack initiation and propagation separately through standard test coupons, showing good correlation with experimental data in mode I, mode II, and mixed-mode loading conditions. Depending on the calibration procedure adopted, the model is applicable to a wide range of stress ratios. In addition, it could be integrated into any standard finite element framework using the desired number of elements through the thickness regardless of the physical amount of layers. This allows easy modification of stacking sequences or the number of layers within the constitutive law without mesh structure changes, facilitating simulation of large-scale composite laminates with minimal accuracy loss and reduced computational costs.}
