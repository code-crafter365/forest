abstract = {The paper specifically examines the analysis of free vibrations in functionally graded Levinson beams, which employ higher-order shear deformation in contrast to the Euler–Bernoulli or Timoshenko beam models. The material features of the functionally graded beam (FGB) vary continuously over its thickness in accordance with specific homogenization schemes. This forms the foundation of the governing equations of dynamics. Using analytical homogeneous solutions, the dynamic stiffness matrix is obtained by establishing a correlation between the magnitudes of forces and displacements at both edges of the beam. Subsequently, the explicit elements of two significant matrices related to the stiffness matrix are derived through symbolic computation. The Wittrick–Williams algorithm is then utilized to tackle the transcendent eigenvalue issue concerning the natural frequencies of FGBs. The numerical findings are verified by comparing them with previously published data and converged solutions from 3D finite element models (FEMs), and the reliability of the findings is assessed through consistency tests. The accuracy of FGB predictions using Levinson’s beam theory is further evaluated by comparing them with Timoshenko’s beam theory and FEM results under varying slenderness ratios, boundary conditions, and material properties.}
