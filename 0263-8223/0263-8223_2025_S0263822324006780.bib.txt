abstract = {Although prestressed shape memory alloy (SMA) has shown a great performance in flexural retrofitting of slender RC columns, its shear strengthening effect for squat RC columns has been barely studied. This study explores the shear strengthening and damage control effects of iron-based SMA (Fe SMA) for squat RC columns. The heat-activated prestressing of Fe SMA was evaluated first at material level, then applied to component level structural testing of RC columns. The four circular RC columns with different retrofitting schemes were tested under quasi-static lateral cyclic loading. The specimens strengthened with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheet and Fe SMA strip exhibited satisfactory global responses without showing significant shear failure. From the visual inspection and non-destructive damage assessment, the prestressed Fe SMA was found to be superior in delaying damage accumulation in concrete compared to CFRP.}
