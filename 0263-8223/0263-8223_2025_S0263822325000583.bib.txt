abstract = {Confining ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) to is an effective method to enhance the strength and deformability of UHPC under compression. For the reliable and cost effective design of FRP-confined UHPC, an accurate and simple-in-form design-oriented axial stress–strain model is essential. In this paper, a review on the existing experimental and theoretical studies on axial stress–strain behavior of FRP-confined UHPC revealed that the existing models are not able to well capture the four-stage stress–strain behavior of FRP-confined UHPC; furthermore, the steel fiber content of UHPC, which has significant influence on the stress–strain behavior of FRP-confined UHPC, has not been well considered in the existing models. Against this background, a new design-oriented stress–strain model consisting of a parabola branch and two linear branches was proposed in the present study, with an FRP efficiency factor also investigated and introduced. A comparison of the performance between the proposed model and the existing models using a large collected test database indicates that the proposed model gives the most accurate predictions to the stress–strain behavior of FRP-confined UHPC and has the potential to be adopted in design provisions.}
