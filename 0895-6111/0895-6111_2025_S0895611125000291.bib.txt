abstract = {Automatic clinical tumor volume (CTV) delineation is pivotal to improving outcomes for interstitial brachytherapy cervical cancer. However, the prominent differences in gray values due to the interstitial needles bring great challenges on deep learning-based segmentation model. In this study, we proposed a novel interstitial-guided segmentation network termed advance reverse guided network (ARGNet) for cervical tumor segmentation with interstitial brachytherapy. Firstly, the location information of interstitial needles was integrated into the deep learning framework via multi-task by a cross-stitch way to share encoder feature learning. Secondly, a spatial reverse attention mechanism is introduced to mitigate the distraction characteristic of needles on tumor segmentation. Furthermore, an uncertainty area module is embedded between the skip connections and the encoder of the tumor segmentation task, which is to enhance the model’s capability in discerning ambiguous boundaries between the tumor and the surrounding tissue. Comprehensive experiments were conducted retrospectively on 191 CT scans under multi-course interstitial brachytherapy. The experiment results demonstrated that the characteristics of interstitial needles play a role in enhancing the segmentation, achieving the state-of-the-art performance, which is anticipated to be beneficial in radiotherapy planning.}
