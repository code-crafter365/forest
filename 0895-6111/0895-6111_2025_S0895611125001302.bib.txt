abstract = {Medical imaging is crucial for clinical practice, providing insight into organ structure and function. Advancements in imaging technologies enable automated image segmentation, which is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. However, challenges like class imbalance, tissue boundary delineation, and tissue interaction complexity persist. The study introduces ConvTNet, a hybrid model that combines Transformer and CNN features to improve renal CT image segmentation. It uses attention mechanisms and feature fusion techniques to enhance precision. ConvTNet uses the KC module to focus on critical image regions, enabling precise tissue boundary delineation in noisy and ambiguous boundaries. The Mix-KFCA module enhances feature fusion by combining multi-scale features and distinguishing between healthy kidney tissue and surrounding structures. The study proposes innovative preprocessing strategies, including noise reduction, data augmentation, and image normalization, that significantly optimize image quality and ensure reliable inputs for accurate segmentation. ConvTNet employs transfer learning, fine-tuning five pre-trained models to bolster model performance further and leverage knowledge from a vast array of feature extraction techniques. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ConvTNet performs exceptionally in multi-label classification and lesion segmentation, with an AUC of 0.9970, sensitivity of 0.9942, DSC of 0.9533, and accuracy of 0.9921, proving its efficacy for precise renal cancer diagnosis.}
