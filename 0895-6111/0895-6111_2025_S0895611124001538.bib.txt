abstract = {In real-world scenarios, medical image segmentation models encounter input images that may deviate from the training images in various ways. These differences can arise from changes in image scanners and acquisition protocols, or even the images can come from a different modality or domain. When the model encounters these out-of-distribution (OOD) images, it can behave unpredictably. Therefore, it is important to develop a system that handles such out-of-distribution images to ensure the safe usage of the models in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method that can be used with any pre-trained segmentation model. Our method utilizes multi-scale representations extracted from the encoder blocks of the segmentation model and employs Mahalanobis distance as a metric to measure the similarity between the input image and the in-distribution images. The segmentation model is pre-trained on a publicly available cardiac short-axis cine MRI dataset. The detection performance of the proposed method is evaluated on 13 different OOD datasets, which can be categorized as near, mild, and far OOD datasets based on their similarity to the in-distribution dataset. The results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art feature space-based and uncertainty-based OOD detection methods across the various OOD datasets. Our method successfully detects near, mild, and far OOD images with high detection accuracy, showcasing the advantage of using the multi-scale and semantically rich representations of the encoder. In addition to the feature-based approach, we also propose a Dice coefficient-based OOD detection method, which demonstrates superior performance for adversarial OOD detection and shows a high correlation with segmentation quality. For the uncertainty-based method, despite having a strong correlation with the quality of the segmentation results in the near OOD datasets, they failed to detect mild and far OOD images, indicating the weakness of these methods when the images are more dissimilar. Future work will explore combining Mahalanobis distance and uncertainty scores for improved detection of challenging OOD images that are difficult to segment.}
