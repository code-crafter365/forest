abstract = {The volume of image data generated in the medical field is continuously increasing. Manual annotation is both costly and prone to human error. Additionally, deep learning-based medical image algorithms rely on large, accurately annotated training datasets, which are expensive to produce and often result in instability. This study introduces LR-COBRAS, an interactive computer-aided data annotation algorithm designed for medical experts. LR-COBRAS aims to assist healthcare professionals in achieving more precise annotation outcomes through interactive processes, thereby optimizing medical image annotation tasks. The algorithm enhances must-link and cannot-link constraints during interactions through a logic reasoning module. It automatically generates potential constraint relationships, reducing the frequency of user interactions and improving clustering accuracy. By utilizing rules such as symmetry, transitivity, and consistency, LR-COBRAS effectively balances automation with clinical relevance. Experimental results based on the MedMNIST＋ dataset and ChestX-ray8 dataset demonstrate that LR-COBRAS significantly outperforms existing methods in clustering accuracy, efficiency, and interactive burden, showcasing superior robustness and applicability. This algorithm provides a novel solution for intelligent medical image analysis. The source code for our implementation is available on https://github.com/cjw-bbxc/MILR-COBRAS.}
