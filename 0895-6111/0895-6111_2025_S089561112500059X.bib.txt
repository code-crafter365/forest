abstract = {Assessing collateral circulation is essential in determining the best treatment for ischemic stroke patients as good collaterals lead to different treatment options, i.e., thrombectomy, whereas poor collaterals can adversely affect the treatment by leading to excess bleeding and eventually death. To reduce inter- and intra-rater variability and save time in radiologist assessments, computer-aided methods, mainly using deep neural networks, have gained popularity. The current literature demonstrates effectiveness when using balanced and extensive datasets in deep learning; however, such data sets are scarce for stroke, and the number of data samples for poor collateral cases is often limited compared to those for good collaterals. We propose a novel approach called CASCADE-FSL to distinguish poor collaterals effectively. Using a small, unbalanced data set, we employ a few-shot learning approach for training using a 2D ResNet-50 as a backbone and designating good and intermediate cases as two normal classes. We identify poor collaterals as anomalies in comparison to the normal classes. Our novel approach achieves an overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.88, 0.88, and 0.89, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the imbalanced dataset challenge and accurately identifying poor collateral circulation cases.}
