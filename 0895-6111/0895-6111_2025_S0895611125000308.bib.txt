abstract = {The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a crucial vascular structure in the brain, vital for diagnosing vascular diseases. During the acute phase of diseases, CT angiography (CTA) is commonly used to locate occlusions within the CoW quickly. After treatment, MR angiography (MRA) is preferred to visualize postoperative vascular structures, reducing radiation exposure. Clinically, the pre- and post-treatment (P&P-T) changes in the CoW are critical for assessing treatment efficacy. However, previous studies focused on single-modality segmentation, leading to cumulative errors when segmenting CoW in CTA and MRA modalities separately. Thus, it is challenging to differentiate whether changes in the CoW are due to segmentation errors or actual therapeutic effects when evaluating treatment efficacy. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework integrating the Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency Network (CMSC-Net) for segmentation and the Semantic Consistency Evaluation Network (SC-ENet) for treatment evaluation. Specifically, CMSC-Net includes two key components: the Modality Pair Alignment Module (MPAM), which generates spatially aligned modality pairs (CTA-MRA, MRA-CTA) to mitigate imaging discrepancies, and the Cross-Modal Attention Module (CMAM), which enhances CTA segmentation by leveraging high-resolution MRA features. Additionally, a novel loss function ensures semantic consistency across modalities, supporting stable network convergence. Meanwhile, SC-ENet automates treatment efficacy evaluation by extracting static vascular features and dynamically tracking morphological changes over time. Experimental results show that CTMSC-Net achieves consistent CoW segmentation across modalities, with SC-ENet delivering high-precision treatment evaluation.}
