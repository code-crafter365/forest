abstract = {Accurately and efficiently estimating the cortical thickness from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is crucial for neuroscientific studies and clinical applications with various large-scale datasets. Diffeomorphic registration-based cortical thickness estimation (DiReCT) is a prominent traditional method of calculating such measures directly from original MRIs by applying diffeomorphic registration on segmented tissues. However, it suffers from prolonged computational time and limited reproducibility, impediments to its application in large-scale studies or real-time environments. This paper proposes a framework for cortical thickness estimation using deep learning-based anatomy segmentation and diffeomorphic registration. The framework begins by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation model to the original image, generating a segmentation map that accurately delineates the cortical boundaries. Subsequently, a pair of distance maps generated from the segmentation map is injected into an unsupervised learning-based registration network for fast and diffeomorphic registration. A novel algorithm based on diffeomorphisms of different time points is proposed to calculate the final thickness map. We systematically evaluated and compared our method with surface-based measures from FreeSurfer on two distinct datasets. The experimental results demonstrated a superior performance of the proposed method, surpassing the performance of DiReCT and DL+DiReCT in terms of time efficiency and consistency with FreeSurfer. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/wujiong-hub/DL-CTE.git.}
