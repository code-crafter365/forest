abstract = {Medical digitization has been intensively developed in the last decade, leading to paving the path for computer-aided medical diagnosis research. Thus, anomaly detection based on machine and deep learning techniques has been extensively employed in healthcare applications, such as medical imaging classification and monitoring of patients’ vital signs. To effectively leverage digitized medical records for identifying challenges in healthcare, this manuscript presents a smart Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) dedicated for medical multimodal data automated diagnosis. A smart healthcare system necessitating medical data management and decision-making is proposed. To deliver timely rapid diagnosis, thread-level parallelism (TLP) is utilized for parallel distribution of classification tasks on three edge computing devices, each employing an AI module for on-device AI classifications. In comparison to existing machine and deep learning classification techniques, the proposed multithreaded architecture realizes a hybrid (ML and DL) processing module on each edge node. In this context, the presented edge computing-based parallel architecture captures a high level of parallelism, tailored for dealing with multiple categories of medical records. The cluster of the proposed architecture encompasses three edge computing Raspberry Pi devices and an edge server. Furthermore, lightweight neural networks, such as MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNet18, are trained and optimized based on genetic algorithms to provide classification of brain tumor, pneumonia, and colon cancer. Model deployment was conducted based on Python programming, where PyCharm is run on the edge server whereas Thonny is installed on edge nodes. In terms of accuracy, the proposed GA-based optimized ResNet18 for pneumonia diagnosis achieves 93.59% predictive accuracy and reduces the classifier computation complexity by 33.59%, whereas an outstanding accuracy of 99.78% and 100% were achieved with EfficientNet-v2 for brain tumor and colon cancer prediction, respectively, while both models preserving a reduction of 25% in the model’s classifier. More importantly, an inference speedup of 28.61% and 29.08% was obtained by implementing parallel 2 DL and 3 DL threads configurations compared to the sequential implementation, respectively. Thus, the proposed multimodal-multithreaded architecture offers promising prospects for comprehensive and accurate anomaly detection of patients’ medical imaging and vital signs. To summarize, our proposed architecture contributes to the advancement of healthcare services, aiming to improve patient medical diagnosis and therapy outcomes.}
