abstract = {Accurate cardiac MRI segmentation is vital for detailed cardiac analysis, yet the manual process is labor-intensive and prone to variability. Despite advancements in MRI technology, there remains a significant need for automated methods that can reliably and efficiently segment cardiac structures. This paper introduces HALSR-Net, a novel multi-level segmentation architecture designed to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of cardiac segmentation from Cine-MRI acquisitions, focusing on the left ventricle (LV). The methodology consists of two main phases: first, the extraction of the region of interest (ROI) using a regression model that accurately predicts the location of a bounding box around the LV; second, the semantic segmentation step based on HALSR-Net architecture. This architecture incorporates a Hybrid Attention Pooling Module (HAPM) that merges attention and pooling mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and capture contextual information. Additionally, a reconstruction module leverages latent space features to further improve segmentation accuracy. Experiments conducted on an in-house clinical dataset and two public datasets (ACDC and LVQuan19) demonstrate that HALSR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, achieving up to 98% accuracy and F1-score for the segmentation of the LV cavity and myocardium. The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a more accurate and robust solution for cardiac MRI segmentation, thereby likely to improve cardiac function analysis and patient care.}
