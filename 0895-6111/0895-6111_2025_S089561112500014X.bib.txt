abstract = {In recent years, with the increasing attention from researchers towards medical imaging, deep learning-based image segmentation techniques have become mainstream in the field, requiring large amounts of manually annotated data. Annotating datasets for Intracranial Hemorrhage(ICH) is particularly tedious and costly. Few-shot segmentation holds significant potential for medical imaging. In this work, we designed a novel segmentation model CGNet to leverage a limited dataset for segmenting ICH regions, we propose a Cross Feature Module (CFM) enhances the understanding of lesion details by facilitating interaction between feature information from the query and support sets and Support Guide Query (SGQ) refines segmentation targets by integrating features from support and query sets at different scales, preserving the integrity of target feature information while further enhancing segmentation detail. We first propose transforming the ICH segmentation task into a few-shot learning problem. We evaluated our model using the publicly available BHSD dataset and the private IHSAH dataset. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art few-shot segmentation models, outperforming methods of 3% and 1.8% in Dice coefficient scores, respectively, and also exceeds the performance of fully supervised segmentation models with the same amount of data.}
