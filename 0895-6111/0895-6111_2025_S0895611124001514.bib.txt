abstract = {Segmentation in medical imaging is an essential and often preliminary task in the image processing chain, driving numerous efforts towards the design of robust segmentation algorithms. Supervised learning methods achieve excellent performances when fed with a sufficient amount of labeled data. However, such labels are typically highly time-consuming, error-prone and expensive to produce. Alternatively, semi-supervised learning approaches leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, and are very useful when only a small fraction of the dataset is labeled. They are particularly useful for cerebrovascular segmentation, given that labeling a single volume requires several hours for an expert. In addition to the challenge posed by insufficient annotations, there are concerns regarding annotation consistency. The task of annotating the cerebrovascular tree is inherently ambiguous. Due to the discrete nature of images, the borders and extremities of vessels are often unclear. Consequently, annotations heavily rely on the expert subjectivity and on the underlying clinical objective. These discrepancies significantly increase the complexity of the segmentation task for the model and consequently impair the results. Consequently, it becomes imperative to provide clinicians with precise guidelines to improve the annotation process and construct more uniform datasets. In this article, we investigate the data dependency of deep learning methods within the context of imperfect data and semi-supervised learning, for cerebrovascular segmentation. Specifically, this study compares various state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods based on unsupervised regularization and evaluates their performance in diverse quantity and quality data scenarios. Based on these experiments, we provide guidelines for the annotation and training of cerebrovascular segmentation models.}
