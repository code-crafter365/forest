abstract = {Accurate brain disease diagnosis based on radiological images is desired in clinical practice as it can facilitate early intervention and reduce the risk of damage. However, existing unimodal image-based models struggle to process high-dimensional 3D brain imaging data effectively. Multimodal disease diagnosis approaches based on medical images and corresponding radiological reports achieved promising progress with the development of vision-language models. However, most multimodal methods handle 2D images and cannot be directly applied to brain disease diagnosis that uses 3D images. Therefore, in this work we develop a multimodal brain disease diagnosis model that takes 3D brain images and their radiological reports as input. Motivated by the fact that radiologists scroll through image slices and write important descriptions into the report accordingly, we propose a slice-description cross-modality interaction mechanism to realize fine-grained multimodal data interaction. Moreover, since previous medical research has demonstrated potential correlation between anatomical location of anomalies and diagnosis results, we further explore the use of brain anatomical prior knowledge to improve the multimodal interaction. Based on the report description, the prior knowledge filters the image information by suppressing irrelevant regions and enhancing relevant slices. Our method was validated with two brain disease diagnosis tasks. The results indicate that our model outperforms competing unimodal and multimodal methods for brain disease diagnosis. In particular, it has yielded an average accuracy improvement of 15.87% and 7.39% compared with the image-based and multimodal competing methods, respectively.}
