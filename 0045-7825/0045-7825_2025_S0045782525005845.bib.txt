abstract = {Multi-material structures are widely used in aerospace, energy, automotive and other industrial fields due to their excellent performance and design flexibility. However, existing multi-material topology optimization methods (MMTO) rarely accounts the interface strength due to the tightly coupled thermal and dynamic loads, causing insufficient structural robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes a topology optimization method to collaboratively optimize structural compliance and interface stresses for multi-material structures, for the first time, simultaneously addressing the coupling of thermal loads and dynamic loads. The extended SIMP method is used to construct a multi-material interpolation model, and the interface layer is extracted by combining the improved double smooth projection (DSP) method. The maximum interface stress is measured by the tensile/compression asymmetric failure mechanism with p-norm aggregation. The study innovatively proposes a model to characterize the maximum interface stress state of the structure under the coupling of dynamic and thermal loads, addressing the displacement fields superposition in a derivable manner given the positive/negative amplitudes. The effectiveness of this method is verified by a series of 2D and 3D numerical examples. The results show that the optimized structure can significantly reduce the interface stress under complex loads while improving the dynamic stability and load-bearing capacity.}
