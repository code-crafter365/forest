abstract = {Computational homogenization methods open the possibility to simulate engineering structures on two scales simultaneously and to accurately describe complex macroscopic material behavior. Their intrinsically high computational cost can be alleviated through model order reduction methods in combination with hyper-reduction. The recently proposed E3C hyper-reduction method is applied to plane-strain hyperelasticity in this work. It is found that errors in the order of 1% are obtained for reinforced composites with phase contrasts of 10–100 and for porous microstructures with compressible and nearly incompressible material behavior using 10–30 integration points, depending on the application. A second topic of the paper is concerned with the remedy of objectivity issues in geometrically nonlinear Galerkin projection applications and the related macroscopic tangent. The resulting simulation tool is provided online and enables the solution of simple two-dimensional two-scale boundary value problems with CPU times in the order of seconds to minutes with training efforts also typically in the minute range.}
