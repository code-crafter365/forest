abstract = {In this paper we present an efficient numerical algorithm to solve stationary problems of hydrodynamic lubrication with cavitation in bearings using the method of characteristics in a finite element framework. The problem is based on the Elrod–Adams mathematical model for the lubricant fluid behavior. To achieve realistic pressure solutions, cavitation must be considered. This leads to a non-linear system of equations including a multivalued operator. In order to solve this problem, we propose a modified Newton algorithm that presents a high convergence speed, allowing one to use small tolerances to solve the problem with high accuracy and efficiency using a low number of iterations, in comparison with alternative numerical algorithms in the literature to solve the same problem. Numerical results are presented and analyzed in the work.}
