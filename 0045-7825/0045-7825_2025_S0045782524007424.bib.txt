abstract = {The aim of this article is to extend Moulinec and Suquet (1998)’s FFT-based method for heterogeneous elasticity to non-periodic Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions. The method is based on a decomposition of the displacement into a known term verifying the boundary conditions and a fluctuation term, with no contribution on the boundary, and described by appropriate sine–cosine series. A modified auxiliary problem involving a polarization tensor is solved within a Galerkin-based method, using an approximation space spanned by sine–cosine series. The elementary integrals emerging from the weak formulation of the equilibrium are approximated by discrete sine–cosine transforms, which makes the method relying on the numerical complexity of Fourier transforms. The method is finally assessed in several problems including kinematic uniform, static uniform and arbitrary Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions.}
