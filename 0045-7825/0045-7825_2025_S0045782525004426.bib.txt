abstract = {Phase-field models have emerged as a powerful framework for simulating complex crack propagation phenomena. However, their highly nonlinear and non-convex variational formulation imposes significant challenges for finding solution through a minimization procedure. Standard Newton-based monolithic solvers often fail to converge, particularly in cases of rapid crack evolution. Traditionally, the alternating minimization approach has been employed to disassemble the non-convexity issue. Although robust, it demands many iterations to converge, leading to high computational costs. We propose a modified L-BFGS method with a line search strategy designed to enhance computational efficiency in phase-field fracture analysis. Moreover, the proposed approach ensures robustness by leveraging a gradient-based criterion to adjust step size dynamically. The approach is evaluated regarding computational cost, accuracy, and robustness through numerical experiments involving brittle and quasi-brittle fracture scenarios. The numerical results, hereby presented, demonstrate that the method offers a promising alternative for efficiently solving large-scale phase-field fracture problems, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy compared to the standard alternating minimization approach.}
