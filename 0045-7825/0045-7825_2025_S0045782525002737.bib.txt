abstract = {In this paper, we develop and numerically study algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners for the cardiac EMI (Extracellular space, cell Membrane, and Intracellular space) model, a recent and biophysically detailed framework for cardiac electrophysiology. The EMI model addresses the limitations of traditional homogenized cardiac models and leverages contemporary computational power to enable high-resolution simulations at the cellular scale. Using a composite Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization, we introduce an AMG-EMI solver for the three dimensional EMI model. Our investigation includes the AMG-EMI scalability performance, both weak and strong, and evaluates its numerical robustness under ischemic conditions, addressing the challenges of heterogeneous media. Numerical tests exploit state-of-the-art pre-exascale supercomputers with hybrid CPU–GPU architectures. The results indicate better scalability performance of the AMG-EMI solver on CPUs compared to GPUs. However, the best solution times achieved using GPUs are up to 40x faster than those obtained on CPUs.}
