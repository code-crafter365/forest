abstract = {We consider elliptic problems in multipatch isogeometric analysis (IGA) where the patch parameterizations may be singular. Specifically, we address cases where certain dimensions of the parametric geometry diminish as the singularity is approached — for example, a curve collapsing into a point (in 2D), or a surface collapsing into a point or a curve (in 3D). To deal with this issue, we develop a robust weak formulation for the second-order Laplace equation that allows trimmed (cut) elements, enforces interface and Dirichlet conditions weakly, and does not depend on specially constructed approximation spaces. Our technique for dealing with the singular maps is based on the regularization of the Riemannian metric tensor, and we detail how to implement this robustly. We investigate the method’s behavior when applied to a square-to-cusp parameterization that allows us to vary the singular behavior’s aggressiveness in how quickly the measure tends to zero when the singularity is approached. We propose a scaling of the regularization parameter to obtain optimal order approximation. Our numerical experiments indicate that the method is robust also for quite aggressive singular parameterizations.}
