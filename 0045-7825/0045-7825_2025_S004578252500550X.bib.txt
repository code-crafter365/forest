abstract = {Recent topology optimization approaches for brittle fracture resistance predominantly rely on phase-field models within classical continuum mechanic framework. However, conventional theories fail to accurately capture size-dependent fracture behaviors influenced by microstructural features. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive fracture resistance optimization framework that incorporates a strain gradient-enhanced phase-field model based on the Wei-Hutchinson strain gradient theory. An adaptive h-refined phase-field fracture formulation is developed, utilizing a mixed staggered solution scheme for efficient fracture simulation. High-order polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-splines) are employed as basis functions to ensure C1-continuity, unify geometry and analysis models, and enhance computational accuracy and efficiency.

High-order polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-splines) are employed as basis functions to ensure C1-continuity, unify geometry and analysis models, and improve computational accuracy and efficiency. Building on this foundation, a strain gradient material isogeometric topology optimization framework is established, embedding a mixed-mode phase-field formulation to capture fracture behavior. Higher-order strain energy terms are incorporated to account for gradient effects, and fracture energy release rates are evaluated through a hybrid of isogeometric analysis and finite difference methods. A multi-objective optimization formulation, combining stiffness and energy release rates via a weighted strategy, is employed to maximize toughness and ultimate load-bearing capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting strain gradient toughening effects enables simultaneous enhancement of both mechanical properties, offering a solid theoretical and computational basis for the cross-scale design of advanced micro- and nanoscale materials with improved fracture resistance.}
