abstract = {The fragmentation of a 1D ring problem is analyzed using the method of characteristics. The fracture strength is treated as a random field. Quantities of interest (QoIs) are macroscopic dynamic strength and energy dissipation (toughness). As a loading length scale falls below the correlation and cohesive length scales, macroscopic strength transitions to its dynamic limit dictated by the mean strength. In contrast, for quasi-static loading rates, macroscopic strength follows the weakest link model and is equal to the minimum point-wise strength. The resulting fragmentation data was run through an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) pipeline, enabling the construction of a Neural Network-based surrogate model for the QoIs requiring only 3 of the original 15 features as input (loading rate, minimum of the strength field and correlation length). Not only were many correlations among the features identified, but we revealed that these dependencies were consistent with the underlying physics. A major consideration was the feature selection process: surrogate models are inspired by computational efficiency, so a parsimonious model is essential. Of particular interest was the performance of a feature selection method based on Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a recent development for interpreting the output of ML models. Although utilization of SHAP in the feature selection process is proven to be successful in the past, our results show that its naive applications can yield subpar results, while a combinatorial approach provided the most robust selection compatible with physical expectations.}
