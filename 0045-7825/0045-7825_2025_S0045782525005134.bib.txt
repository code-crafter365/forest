abstract = {Recognizing that traditional Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), although robust in capturing free-surface dynamics, can suffer from high computational costs and frequent remeshing challenges. Thus, this work introduces a novel semi-implicit hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian PFEM (HEL-PFEM) with nodal-integration framework for simulating incompressible free-surface flow problems with enhanced stability and computational efficiency. The proposed approach partitions the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains. A refined Lagrangian PFEM with fine mesh resolution is employed in regions dominated by free-surface phenomena; elsewhere, a fixed-grid Eulerian method with a coarser discretization is used. This dual strategy leverages the strengths of both Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions, thereby overcoming conventional issues in free-surface tracking and mesh distortion typical of ALE methods. To ensure numerical stability, the framework incorporates the Characteristic-Based Split (CBS) method to suppress convective instabilities and the Stabilized Pressure Gradient Projection (SPGP) technique to enhance pressure stabilization under equal-order interpolation. A novel efficient volume control algorithm is integrated to compensate for the volume loss often observed in semi-implicit formulations. The framework’s performance is validated through an array of benchmark tests and a complex two-phase simulation of a submarine landslide. The results underscore its potential for delivering high numerical fidelity with moderate computational expense across a wide range of free-surface and multiphase flow applications.}
