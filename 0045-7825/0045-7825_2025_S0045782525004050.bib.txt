abstract = {The 4th-order partial differential equations modeling the flexoelectric effect at finite deformations are considered, accounting for direct and converse effects. Its numerical solution, using standard C0 Finite Elements, is carried out through the development of a C0 Interior Penalty method (C0-IPM) with a Newton–Raphson nonlinear solver. The simulation of metamaterials by means of generalized periodicity conditions is also addressed within the C0-IPM framework. The order of convergence of the method is assessed in a synthetic test, studying the effect of the penalty parameters in the accuracy of the scheme. The method is also applied to the solution of a cantilever beam problem, and to the simulation of metamaterials at large deformations.}
