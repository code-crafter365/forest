abstract = {The scientific core of the paper at hand is to provide a new scaled boundary finite element formulation for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media in the time domain. It derives the governing differential equations in a form that allows to lift the common assumption of constant material properties along the so-called radial coordinate within the elements. It uses finite differences to resolve the variations in material properties at a desired number of points within each element. This choice effectively decomposes the computational load into independent local problems and a single coupled global system, rendering the new solution method highly parallelizable. The motivation to develop such a scheme is to use the scaled boundary finite element method in the context of full-waveform inversion, a non-destructive testing technique to identify flaws in material using wave signals. The derivation of the new scheme is, therefore, embedded in the context of full-waveform inversion in the time domain and verified at benchmark examples of this field. Demonstrated by a simple OpenMP implementation using 12 threads on a personal laptop, the new formulation outperforms the existing approach in terms of both the quality of reconstructed images and the required computational time.}
