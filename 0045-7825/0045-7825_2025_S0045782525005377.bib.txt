abstract = {Shear localization is ubiquitous in ductile materials undergoing plastic deformation where deformation becomes highly concentrated within narrow bands. For the computer simulation of this phenomenon, we study shear localization in strain rate-sensitive materials using the virtual element method (VEM) and the Bodner–Partom viscoplasticity model. The VEM is a generalization of the finite element method that works on polytopal meshes. We first present an implicit stress-integration algorithm for the Bodner–Partom model, making use of a change of variables to recast plastic flow as a bounded nonlinear problem, thus enabling the use of simple bracketing root-finding methods. Then, we derive the algorithmically-consistent tangent stiffness tensor tailored for seamless implementation within an implicit virtual/finite element framework. We verify our implementation using quasi-static tensile tests and compact forced simple shear problems. Finally, we turn our attention to a dynamic shear localization problem. Our results demonstrate the convergence, upon both h- and p-refinement, to the finite shear band width implied by the Bodner–Partom model.}
