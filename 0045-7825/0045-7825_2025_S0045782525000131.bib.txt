abstract = {This manuscript introduces a novel neural network-based computational framework for constitutive modeling of thermo-electro-mechanically coupled materials at finite strains, with four key innovations: (i) It supports calibration of neural network models with various input forms, such as Ψnn(F,E0,θ), enn(F,D0,η), Υnn(F,E0,η), or Γnn(F,D0,θ), with F representing the deformation gradient tensor, E0 and D0 the electric field and electric displacement field, respectively and finally, θ and η, the temperature and entropy fields. These models comply with physical laws and material symmetries by utilizing isotropic or anisotropic invariants corresponding to the material’s symmetry group. (ii) A calibration approach is developed for the case of experimental data, where entropy η is typically unmeasurable. (iii) The framework accommodates models like enn(F,D0,η), specially convenient for the imposition of polyconvexity across the three physics involved. A detailed calibration study is conducted evaluating various neural network architectures and considering a large variety of ground truth thermo-electro-mechanical constitutive models. The results demonstrate excellent predictive performance on larger datasets, validated through complex finite element simulations using both ground truth and neural network-based models. Crucially, the framework can be straightforwardly extended to scenarios involving other physics.}
