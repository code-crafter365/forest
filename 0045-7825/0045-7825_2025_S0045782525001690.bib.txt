abstract = {Allen–Cahn equation is a reaction–diffusion equation and is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen–Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives, and the large system size required by the space–time approach. To overcome these challenges, we propose solving the L2 gradient flow of the Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional, which is equivalent to the Allen–Cahn equation, thereby avoiding the second-order spatial derivatives associated with the Allen–Cahn equation. A minimizing movement scheme is employed to solve the gradient flow problem, eliminating the complexities of a space–time approach. We utilize a separable neural network that efficiently represents the phase field through low-rank tensor decomposition. As we use the minimizing movement scheme to numerically solve the gradient flow problem, we thus, refer to the proposed method as the Separable Deep Minimizing Movement (SDMM) method. The evaluation of the functional in the minimizing movement scheme using the Gauss quadrature technique bypasses the inaccuracies associated with collocation techniques traditionally used to solve partial differential equations. A hyperbolic tangent transformation is introduced on the phase field prior to the evaluation of the functional to ensure that it remains strictly bounded within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that this transformation helps to improve the accuracy and efficiency significantly. The proposed method resolves the challenges faced by state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, outperforming them in both accuracy and efficiency. It is also the first machine learning method to achieve an order of magnitude speed improvement over the finite element method. In addition to its formulation and computational implementation, several case studies illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.11The source code is available on GitHub. - https://github.com/vmattey/SDMM.}
