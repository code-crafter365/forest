abstract = {In this paper, we propose and analyze both conforming and nonconforming virtual element methods (VEMs) for the fully nonlinear second-order elliptic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations with Cordes coefficients. By incorporating stabilization terms, we establish the well-posedness of the proposed methods, thus avoiding the need to construct a discrete Miranda-Talenti estimate. We derive the optimal error estimate in the discrete H2 norm for both numerical formulations. Furthermore, a semismooth Newton’s method is employed to linearize the discrete problems. Several numerical experiments using the lowest-order VEMs are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods and to validate our theoretical results.}
