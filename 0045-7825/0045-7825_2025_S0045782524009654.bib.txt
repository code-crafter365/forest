abstract = {The paper deals with the analysis of trimmed geometry by means of the isogeometric Boundary Element Method. An alternative to published local trimming methods is presented, which preserves accuracy and is easier to implement. Local approaches involve the trimming of the basis functions and integration regions. The trimming of basis functions implies that discontinuous collocation has to be applied, which unnecessarily increases the degrees of freedom, since collocation points are no longer shared between patches. The presented global approach does not involve the trimming of basis functions and integration elements and re-establishes the possibility to use continuous collocation. Two test examples are presented that demonstrate the advantages of the global approach over the local approach. A practical example in underground construction with medium geometrical complexity has been analysed with the global method. It is demonstrated that results comparable to the local approach can be obtained with fewer degrees of freedom.}
