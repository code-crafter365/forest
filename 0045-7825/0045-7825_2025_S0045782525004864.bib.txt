abstract = {Engineering structures in long-term service inevitably experience damage across regions due to complex environments, driving the need for online damage identification. Traditional physics-driven methods face efficiency challenges, while data-driven approaches struggle to balance precision and parameterization. Furthermore, conventional neural networks struggle to effectively represent multi-source uncertainties originating from structural and environmental variations, as they inherently produce deterministic damage state estimates. To this end, this study proposes radial basis functions to construct the structural damage function, using a relatively small number of damage parameters to describe the damage state. An interval deep neural network (DNN) model is developed to map structural strain responses and loading conditions to interval-based damage states. Damage scenario samples are generated through a parameter sampling and truncation strategy, with theoretical strain data for each sample expanded within a certain noise range to construct the dataset. The interval DNN is trained through a loss function that incorporates interval width, interval coverage rate, and midpoint accuracy. A quantitative evaluation index is established to assess the credibility of trained models and to serve as the basis for their future practical application. Two numerical examples and one experimental case demonstrate the proposed method’s performance across diverse materials, damage scenarios, and uncertainty levels, suggesting promise for real-world use to some extent.}
