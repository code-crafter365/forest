abstract = {Peridynamics (PD) is a nonlocal continuum mechanics theory over two scales, where the macro-scale material responses are built based on the interaction forces among meso-scale material points. Unlike molecular dynamics, where the pairwise bond forces consist only of normal components along the bonds, the peridynamics bond forces proposed in our recent work can have both normal and tangential components to capture complicated macroscale material responses without introducing micro-polar continuum theory (Madenci et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023; Hu and Li, 2023). In this study, we developed a completed formulation of nonlocal-deformation-field-driven bond-based peridynamics (NDFD BB-PD). In this formulation, the alignment of nonlocal deformation field and meso-scale bond kinematics leads to the compatibility of meso-scale pairwise bond potentials and the strain energy density of macro-scale continuum. One significant consequence of this is the nonlocal stress measures derived through the extended Noll’s Lemma being identical to that derived from the strain energy density. The key features of the proposed formulation include: (1) In contrast to conventional peridynamic formulations, the proposed formulation possesses consistent kinematic relations in meso- and marco-scales, and hence completely resolve the issue of zero-energy mode that inherently and persistently exists in the current peridynamics computations; (2) The introduction of bond shear deformation enables the formulation to capture both brittle and ductile fracturing behaviors of materials; (3) this work establishes a completed framework of nonlocal continuum mechanics, which coherently integrates all essential elements required in a mechanics theory, including kinematics, momentum balance equations, constitutive relations, and the principle of material frame-indifference (stress objectivity); and (4) it provides a possibility to unify bond-based and state-based peridynamics. Numerical examples, covering a range of problems from elasticity to nonlinear cohesive fracture, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}
