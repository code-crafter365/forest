abstract = {Solving reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) problems requires highly computational demand in finite element and sensitivity analyses, particularly for obtaining high-resolution results. To overcome this issue, a new data-driven RBTO framework is introduced by using the problem-independent machine learning method, which aims to significantly decrease the computational time incurred by finite element and sensitivity analyses. Subsequently, a novel neural networks model is established by using deep learning techniques, while the offline training serves as a surrogate model for calculating the numerical basic function. Furthermore, a novel sensitivity analysis method has been developed, which utilizes the basic function and deep learning neural networks to map the sensitivity information from the macroscopic level to the microscopic level. The results illustrate that the proposed method can substantially decrease the computational time of RBTO with high-resolution results.}
