abstract = {Crack detection is critical for ensuring structural integrity; however, existing methods often suffer from limited applicability and inefficient convergence. This study introduces a topology optimization framework for efficient detection of internal cracks in structures through structural surface deformation in the context of peridynamics (PD). From the perspective of topology optimization, the proposed methodology reformulates the complex crack detection task as an optimization problem over the spatial distribution of cracks. Leveraging the unique concept of "bond" in PD, irregular crack patterns are systematically translated into a topological representation of bond states. Benefiting from this uniform bond state, a sensitivity-based criterion, embedded within the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) algorithm, is employed to efficiently optimize the crack distribution. A novel evaluation metric is developed to quantify the crack distribution, which can effectively capture the influence of internal cracks on the mechanical response of the boundary. An energy functional incorporating crack closure is constructed via a parametric variational principle within the PD framework, enhancing the accuracy of structural response predictions. This innovative topology-driven strategy substantially improves both the convergence and accuracy of crack detection process. Numerical examples and experimental validations confirm that the proposed method can detect different crack distributions in various structural configurations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. Overall, the integration of PD with topology optimization in this study offers a promising framework for efficient and accurate crack detection in complex structures.}
