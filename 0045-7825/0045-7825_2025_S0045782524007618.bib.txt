abstract = {This paper presents a convolution tensor decomposition based model reduction method for solving the Allen–Cahn equation. The Allen–Cahn equation is usually used to characterize phase separation or the motion of anti-phase boundaries in materials. Its solution is time-consuming when high-resolution meshes and large time scale integration are involved. To resolve these issues, the convolution tensor decomposition method is developed, in conjunction with a stabilized semi-implicit scheme for time integration. The development enables a powerful computational framework for high-resolution solutions of Allen–Cahn problems, and allows the use of relatively large time increments for time integration without violating the discrete energy law. To further improve the efficiency and robustness of the method, an adaptive algorithm is also proposed. Numerical examples have confirmed the efficiency of the method in both 2D and 3D problems. Orders-of-magnitude speedups were obtained with the method for high-resolution problems, compared to the finite element method. The proposed computational framework opens numerous opportunities for simulating complex microstructure formation in materials on large-volume high-resolution meshes at a deeply reduced computational cost.}
