abstract = {Thermally induced cracking remains a complex challenge in engineering applications, particularly for the precise computational simulation of crack patterns. Although the nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage (NMMD) model has shown potential in simulating complex cracking, there is a lack of research on the thermal fracture problems or physical mechanisms of meso-scale damage. In this study, a thermal-mechanical coupled NMMD model is developed to capture the thermal conductivity degradation resulting from damage. The breaking of the meso-scale point pair is governed by the mechanical elongation obtained by subtracting the thermal elongation from the total elongation. Moreover, the physicalized NMMD model is established through the physical description of the point-pair damage evolution process. To be specific, the brittleness index and critical elongation of point pairs can be strictly calibrated using their tensile strength and fracture energy. Finally, different types of thermally induced fracture problems were investigated, including ceramic quenching, dynamic crack branching in a centrally heated disk, and quasi-static fracture in a cruciform plate under thermo-mechanical loads. The results show close alignment with previous research and experimental observations, demonstrating that the proposed thermo-mechanical coupled physicalized NMMD model can accurately simulate the thermally induced fracture process.}
