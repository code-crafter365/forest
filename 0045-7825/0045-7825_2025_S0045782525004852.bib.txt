abstract = {To achieve low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life prediction and reliability assessment for mechanical structures, a collaborative moving regression-based surrogate modeling (CMR-SM) framework is proposed by fusing the collaborative moving regression (CMR) strategy, heuristic algorithm, adaptive hybrid surrogate modeling method, and matrix analysis theory. In this framework, the CMR strategy is developed from the decomposition-coordination (DC) method and moving least squares (MLS) technique to reduce model nonlinearity and acquire effective samples; the optimal radius for compact support region is determined through quadratic interpolation optimization (QIO); Matrix analysis theory is applied to construct vectors and cell arrays of unknown parameters, synchronously establishing the mathematical model. Under this concept, the CMR-based response surface method (CMR-RSM), CMR-based Kriging model (CMR-KM), CMR-based support vector machine (CMR-SVM), and CMR-based artificial neural network (CMR-ANN) are further developed. Considering the robustness of model, an adaptive weighting technique is employed to further develop the collaborative moving regression-based adaptive hybrid surrogate modeling (CMR-AHSM) method. The excellent modeling capabilities and simulation performance of the proposed method are validated through a numerical case (i.e., the probability analysis of a nested nonlinear function) and an engineering case (i.e., the LCF life reliability assessment of turbine blisk). The proposed method provides new insights for LCF life reliability assessment in engineering structures.}
