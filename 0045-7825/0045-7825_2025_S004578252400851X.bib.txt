abstract = {We develop a mixed finite element domain decomposition method on non-matching grids for the Biot system of poroelasticity. A displacement–pressure vector mortar function is introduced on the interfaces and utilized as a Lagrange multiplier to impose weakly continuity of normal stress and normal velocity. The mortar space can be on a coarse scale, resulting in a multiscale approximation. We establish existence, uniqueness, stability, and error estimates for the semi-discrete continuous-in-time formulation under a suitable condition on the richness of the mortar space. We further consider a fully-discrete method based on the backward Euler time discretization and show that the solution of the algebraic system at each time step can be reduced to solving a positive definite interface problem for the composite mortar variable. A multiscale stress–flux basis is constructed, which makes the number of subdomain solves independent of the number of iterations required for the interface problem, and weakly dependent on the number of time steps. We present numerical experiments verifying the theoretical results and illustrating the multiscale capabilities of the method for a heterogeneous benchmark problem.}
