abstract = {This study presents a novel peridynamic-based multiscale framework for modeling the interfacial cohesive failure behaviors in nanocomposites. We first proposed a cohesive constituent relationship for the peridynamic bond across the interface, and then derived the analytical expression for the interface's cohesive characteristics, including the initial stiffness, strength, and toughness, within the context of bond-based peridynamic theory. Subsequently, we propose a multiscale approach to calibrate the model parameters based on the molecular mechanics analysis of the material interface. The proposed peridynamic model was numerically implemented through an implicit dynamic scheme. The model’s validation is demonstrated through the benchmark interface traction-separation analyses and the double cantilever beam tests. Finally, the representative volume element models considering thermo-mechanical loading conditions were established to investigate the failure behaviors of the carbon nanotube composites. The proposed peridynamic-based framework bridges the nanoscale material properties with the macroscale interface mechanical response, which offers a unified tool for the interface cohesive failure modeling of nanocomposites within the peridynamic framework.}
