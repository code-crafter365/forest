abstract = {This work introduces a novel approach to tackle topology optimization problems where both the external load and stiffness matrix are boundary-dependent. The proposed algorithm is based on the concept of density gradient methods, a class of density-based approaches that do not require additional fields or parametric curves for the boundary recognition, unlike other methods in the literature. The core idea behind density gradient methods is that boundaries can be identified as regions in the design domain in which the solution exhibits significant gradients, transitioning from material-filled areas to voids. Building on this concept, the new algorithm offers significant advantages over existing density gradient methods. First, it achieves higher accuracy by solving boundary integrals directly, avoiding the transition to volume integrals commonly employed in other methods. Second, it is substantially more efficient due to two key factors: much of the computation occurs during preprocessing, and it avoids the need for fine meshes or frequent remeshing required for accurate volume integral solutions. These benefits are enabled by the distinct algorithmic approach and design choices of this method. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated through two physical problems. The first involves heat conduction with convective boundary conditions, where both the external load and stiffness matrix are boundary-dependent. The second addresses warping function topology optimization, a challenging problem requiring both boundary detection and definition of the boundary line outwards direction. The proposed algorithm demonstrates excellent accuracy and efficiency in all case studies.}
