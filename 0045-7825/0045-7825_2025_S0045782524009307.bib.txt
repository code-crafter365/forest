abstract = {This paper introduces a versatile multi-material topology optimization approach based on an Implicit Topology Description Function (ITDF). The proposed method employs a node-based topological descriptive function as a design variable, and uses a specialized interpolation model to represent the material distribution within the design domain. By decoupling the design variables from material properties, this approach addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accommodates a broader spectrum of material combinations. Notably, the method only requires a single set of design variables, regardless of the number of materials involved. The independence of the topology control mesh from the analysis mesh leads to a “multi-resolution” effect, significantly reducing the number of design variables compared to conventional techniques. The continuity and non-local characteristics of the chosen topology description function interpolation enable a relatively smooth transition between different materials without any filtering technique. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance in further reducing the number of design variables, expanding the applicability of materials, and ensuring numerical stability.}
