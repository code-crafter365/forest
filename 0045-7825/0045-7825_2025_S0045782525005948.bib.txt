abstract = {Only single-fidelity information is considered in existing studies when conducting reliability analysis for small failure probabilities, making it difficult to further improve computational accuracy and efficiency for estimating structural failure where highly nonlinear limit state functions and time-consuming High-Fidelity (HF) finite element simulation exist at the same time. To address this challenge and estimate small failure probabilities in a more accurate way, a Parallel Adaptive Ensemble of Kriging models based on the Importance Sampling (PAEK-IS) is developed in this study. The proposed new method comprises the following strategies: (1) a new adaptive Ensemble of Kriging (EK) models is first developed based on the co-Kriging and Kriging models; (2) based on Kriging prediction, the Error-based Stopping Criterion for Importance Sampling (ESCIS) is presented for estimating the small failure probabilities in a more efficient way; (3) to efficiently and accurately select new best points and refine the EK model, a new active learning function is constructed, in which the global error and joint Probability Density Function (PDF) of input random variables are considered. Several examples are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}
