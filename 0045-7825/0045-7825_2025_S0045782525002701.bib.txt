abstract = {This study proposes a stabilized LSMPS method for simulating free surface flows with moving wall. In this stabilized LSMPS method, a novel wall velocity model is proposed for velocity divergence calculation and velocity interpolation. The proposed method also combines type-A and type-B LSMPS to enhance both accuracy and stability. Type-A LSMPS is applied to internal particles, while type-B scheme is used for free-surface and sub-free-surface particles. Additionally, type-B LSMPS is employed to interpolate the velocity after particle shifting. The stability of both type-A and type-B schemes is enhanced by the incorporation of positive values into the diagonal element of the least-squares matrix. To verify the developed LSMPS method, several three-dimensional numerical simulations are conducted.}
