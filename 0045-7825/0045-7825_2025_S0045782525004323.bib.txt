abstract = {This study presents a multiscale approach to derive an equivalent continuum for locally resonant acoustic metamaterials (LRAMs) where one or more constituents exhibit Kelvin–Voigt viscoelasticity, which yields a nonclassically damped problem. A computational homogenization procedure that relies on the Hill–Mandel principle and a relaxed scale separation is applied to the reduced unit cell model in the state-space formulation. Non-standard constitutive relations are obtained at the macroscale, accounting for microscale dynamics upscaled as enrichment field variables. The proposed dynamic homogenization derives closed-form macroscale constitutive relations that capture metamaterial behavior, such as negative (complex) material properties and Willis coupling coefficients. The resulting homogenized continuum is suitable for both time- and frequency-domain analyses, for which multiple formulations are provided. Numerical examples of a metamaterial with a symmetric unit cell and dipolar resonances demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed multiscale approach in the applicable frequency range. Dispersion analysis and steady-state frequency-domain finite-size boundary value problems are compared to direct numerical simulations, exhibiting excellent accuracy and substantially reduced computational costs.}
