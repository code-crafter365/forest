abstract = {In this study, an isogeometric gradient damage framework is proposed to model thermo-mechanical fracture in isotropic medium. The spurious damage evolution is mitigated by incorporating a transient gradient parameter. A modified version of the Mazars strain is introduced, enabling the model to better accommodate a wide range of quasi-brittle materials exhibiting distinct tension-compression asymmetry, thereby broadening the applicability of the proposed framework. A novel dual adaptive strategy is proposed, which synergistically combines local mesh refinement with stepwise loading adjustment to optimize computational efficiency. To facilitate local mesh refinement, truncated hierarchical non-uniform rational B-spline (TH-NURBS) is employed, providing a flexible and accurate representation of the geometry. Complex geometries are modeled using multiple TH-NURBS patches that are coupled through Nitsche’s method. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures thermo-mechanical fracture behaviour in quasi-brittle materials with complex geometries and the dual adaptive strategy ensures optimal computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.}
