abstract = {The Stefan problem describes thermal processes between two material phases undergoing phase transitions. It arises in numerous natural and engineering processes, such as ice melting, welding, and metal additive manufacturing. Simulating the Stefan problem remains challenging. Accurately resolving the material interface evolution and imposing the boundary conditions are troublesome for existing interface-tracking, diffusive interface, and immersed boundary methods. In this paper, we present an enriched immersed boundary method (EIBM) assisted by a level set method to address these challenges. The core concept of EIBM is to enrich the degrees of freedom of the temperature field of the cut elements, similar to cutFEM, to handle the boundary conditions involving gradient jumps on the moving material interface. Without re-meshing or mesh motion, the method can resolve all the physical unknowns with a single background mesh and achieve interface accuracy comparable to the boundary-fitted method. Besides, a special level set approach is formulated to capture the evolution of the material interface during phase transition. The temperature and level set fields are solved in a fully coupled way using a mixed formulation. The level set field is convected by a material interface velocity based on the temperature field, and the zero level set is triangulated and then immersed into the background mesh to impose the boundary condition for temperature with the EIBM. Furthermore, we augment the proposed method with a level set-based surface reconstruction approach, which allows exact volumetric integration of the cut elements. The performance of the proposed method is comprehensively evaluated through three numerical examples: conjugate heat conduction with high material property ratios, aluminum solidification, and thermal modeling of the 2018 NIST metal additive manufacturing test series.}
