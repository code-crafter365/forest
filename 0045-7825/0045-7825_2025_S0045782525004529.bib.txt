abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained recognition as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating the PDE residual directly into the neural network’s loss function. However, while effective in many cases, standard PINNs often struggle with accuracy. Gradient-Enhanced PINNs (GPINNs) were developed to address these issues by enforcing zero residual gradients, but they have not been able to sufficiently guide the learning process in many demanding physical applications. In this work, we introduce two novel method, RCuPINN, and CuPINN, which significantly improves both the accuracy and training efficiency of PINNs. These methods are built on the key observation that the residual over the entire domain can be viewed as a manifold in Rd+1, where d is the dimensionality of the problem. Ideally, this manifold should exhibit zero value across the domain with minimal curvature in regions where the solution is smooth. By enforcing a smooth and flat residual manifold with zero curvature, we introduce a stronger inductive bias that promotes more accurate residual learning, backed by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that minimizing the curvature inherently reduces the gradient, which further enhances the solution’s accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage Hutchinson Trace Estimation to compute the eigenvalues of the curvature, allowing us to directly minimize the curvature of the residual surface. This refined loss function leads to more efficient training and improved accuracy. Additionally, we combine our method with GPINNs to create hybrid approaches, RCuGPINN, CuGPINN. Extensive experiments on both linear and nonlinear PDEs demonstrate that our methods achieve residual and approximation errors on the order of 10−1 compared to existing approaches, including GPINNs. This substantial reduction in error illustrates the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our methods.}
