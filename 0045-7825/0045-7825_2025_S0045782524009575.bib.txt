abstract = {We propose a new discrete FFT-based method for computational homogenization of micromechanics on a regular grid that is simple, fast and robust. The discretization scheme is based on a tetrahedral stencil that generates two independent mechanical problems on distinct face centred cubic subgrids. The resulting equilibrium problems may be merged into a single one that is solved by a gradient-based method equivalent to the original Moulinec–Suquet basic scheme. The tetrahedral stencil displays three crucial properties. First, and most importantly, the Fourier representation of the associated Green operator is defined for any finite q-vector generated by the periodic boundary conditions and that does not belong to the reciprocal lattice of the discrete grids. As shown in the paper, this property guarantees that, for any elastic contrast, even infinite, mechanical equilibrium is always mathematically stable, i.e. free of any unphysical patterns, such as oscillations, ringing or checkerboarding, a property which is not shared by the original Moulinec–Suquet discretization (Moulinec and Suquet, 1994;1998) nor by the rotated scheme proposed by Willot (2015). Second, the components of tensorial quantities are all defined on the same location, which permits the use of any elastic anisotropy and any spatial variation of the material fields. Third, convergence to equilibrium using the simplest iterative scheme, i.e. the basic scheme, is fast and the number of iterates stabilizes at high contrast, so that infinite contrast is obtained without additional computational cost. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed tetrahedral stencil are assessed through several case studies, including microstructures that consist of a single inclusion with various elastic properties (finite eigenstrain, void, hard precipitate), a microstructure that contains simultaneously soft and stiff inclusions and complex 3D microstructures with random spherical voids. Convergence of effective elastic properties with grid refinement is investigated. An implementation of the tetrahedral stencil within the polarization-based fixed point algorithm of Monchiet–Bonnet is also proposed.}
