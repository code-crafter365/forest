abstract = {High-order methods have recently been shown to be an effective tool for high-fidelity flow computations like direct numerical simulations and large-eddy simulations because of their strong balance between accuracy and computational cost. In this work, a high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) is developed to solve the chemically reacting Navier-Stokes equations. To handle the disparate length and time scales associated with these equations, we develop a novel method which combines the spectral accuracy of the SEM with the flexibility of the DG approach. The framework, implemented in the spectral element code Nek5000, is well suited to capture turbulence in smooth regions of the flow, while maintaining numerical stability in the presence of shocks. An entropy-residual based artificial viscosity is added to smooth shocked regions of flow, and a positivity-preserving limiter is implemented to suppress non-physical oscillations. These enhancements support the numerical stability of the hydrodynamic sub-step, which is decoupled from the chemistry integration through a second-order operator splitting method. A series of smooth and discontinuous validation cases are presented in increasing physical and computational complexity for both inviscid and viscous flows. In particular, simulations of canonical one-dimensional and two-dimensional detonations are performed, and the high-order numerical results are validated against available literature data. Additional validation studies are carried out for classical three-dimensional numerical simulations of incompressible and compressible turbulent flows.}
