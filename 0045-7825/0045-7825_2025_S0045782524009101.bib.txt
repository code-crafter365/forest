abstract = {Currently, due to the complexity of multi-scale topology optimization (MSTO), most of them are optimized based on deterministic conditions, ignoring the influence of uncertain factors on multi-scale structural design optimization. This article aims to develop a novel approach to probabilistic reliability-based topology optimization of multi-scale structure (RBTOM) to address the optimization design problem considering external loading uncertainties. Firstly, the level set function (LSF) is used to represent the geometric shape of the lattice micro-structure, and the optimization parameters are defined. Secondly, an offline database is established based on the numerical homogenization to obtain the equivalent stiffness matrix of the structure. Then, a minimum relative volume fraction nested two-layer iterative algorithm that meets the target reliability requirements is established. The inner layer is based on the reliability analysis of the reliability index approach (RIA), and the outer layer is used for coarse-scale topology optimization, and then reconstructed based on the optimization results. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by two examples of different level set functions.}
