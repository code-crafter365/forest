abstract = {Aircraft design requires extensive aerodynamic data to characterize various flight conditions throughout the aircraft’s flight envelope. Typically, the aerodynamic data is acquired through wind tunnel testing or numerical analysis, which are costly and inevitably entails multiple sources of uncertainty. In the present work, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian neural network (MFBNN) framework for multi-source aerodynamic data fusion with heterogeneous uncertainties. We first employ mean-field variational inference (VI) to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO), yielding informative priors for BNN hyperparameters. Then, the stochastic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method is adopted to estimate their posteriors. Notably, we introduce mini-batch learning to address a key constraint of traditional HMC methods, particularly in the aerodynamic modeling scenarios involving large sample sizes, where the computation of required gradients for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system is impractical. The proposed MFBNN framework is applied in three cases, including the RAE2822 airfoil, the ONERA M6 wing and the NASA Common Research Model. The results demonstrate that the proposed MFBNN framework can remarkably improve accuracy and outperform the multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression model.}
