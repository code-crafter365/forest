abstract = {With the development of aviation technology, the optimal design of composite structures for aircraft has gradually become a key issue in the field of structural optimization research. However, in the actual engineering situation, it is also necessary to consider the coupling of disciplines brought by the complex environment as well as the uncertainty factors, so there is an urgent need for an efficient method to optimize the design. In this paper, a method based on sequential non-probabilistic reliability optimization design is proposed for the wing structure of aircraft, considering the aerodynamic structural coupling state. The method consists of three parts. 1) Considering the discrete mechanical properties of composite materials, a non-probabilistic reliability optimization design method based on the sequential idea is established. 2) Considering the environmental uncertainty, a fast aerodynamic load calculation method based on the 3D panel method is established for equivalent beams. 3) Comprehensive optimization iteration is carried out by the stiffness leveling tandem with the first two parts. The above process needs to be repeated until the change of aerodynamic loads in the iteration can be neglected. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by numerical examples.}
