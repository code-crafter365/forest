abstract = {In multi-component vibrating systems, some components can be inherently complex or expensive to model using first principles of physics. This creates a serious bottleneck in the dynamic analysis of the built-up system. In more complicated scenarios, even a baseline mechanistic model may not be available to update these sub-components. Practical examples of such systems include dampers, bridge supports, and instruments mounted on a vehicle. This lack of physical detail poses a significant mathematical challenge in predicting the response of the coupled system. We propose a novel coupling method for this hybrid system combining a physics-based model with a neural network. The key challenge in this coupling is to develop a numerical integrator. An iterative scheme is proposed for this purpose. The proposed method is numerically tested for a wide variety of scenarios such as linear and nonlinear systems, presence of measurement noise, and availability of only acceleration data versus full field data. From these numerical studies the proposed method is found to capture the coupled dynamics accurately.}
