abstract = {The flow of incompressible fluid in highly permeable porous media in vorticity - velocity - Bernoulli pressure form leads to a double saddle-point problem in the Navier–Stokes–Brinkman–Forchheimer equations. The paper establishes, for small sources, the existence of solutions on the continuous and discrete level of lowest-order piecewise divergence-free Crouzeix–Raviart finite elements. The vorticity employs a vector version of the pressure space with normal and tangential velocity jump penalisation terms. A simple Raviart–Thomas interpolant leads to pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An explicit residual-based a posteriori error estimate allows for efficient and reliable a posteriori error control. The efficiency for the Forchheimer nonlinearity requires a novel discrete inequality of independent interest. The implementation is based upon a light-weight forest-of-trees data structure handled by a highly parallel set of adaptive mesh refining algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal robustness of the a posteriori error estimates and improved convergence rates by adaptive mesh-refining.}
