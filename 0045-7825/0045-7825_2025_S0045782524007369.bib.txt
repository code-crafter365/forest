abstract = {When simulating pressure-driven fracture with the Finite Element Method (FEM), significant difficulties can arise upon representing newly formed complex damage surfaces and their concurrent crack face loading. Application of this loading can also be required when additional physics is involved as in the case of hydraulic fracture where fluid physics inside a damage need to be considered. This paper presents a new Finite Element based practical numerical framework which can model pressure-driven fractures as they form on-the-fly without remeshing. The exact location of physical discontinuities passing through the element domain can be represented in the numerical model. The numerical framework can be implemented as a user-defined element and can be integrated into any FE package. A new element (called pressure element) is formulated with the capability to apply pressure and associated forces onto the crack surfaces in an adaptive manner. This element is verified using relevant examples from literature. The framework can also be configured for multi-physics problems where crack face loading is dictated by an additional physics. The element formulation is then extended for multi-physics problems involving fluid–solid interaction. The formulation provides the capability for multi-physics coupling adaptively as the crack propagates. The element is used to successfully simulate a test case from literature using different solution procedures (iterative and simultaneous). This element is also used to model failure in different pressure vessel problems to demonstrate its potential use in structural applications. A new higher-scale vessel element is developed which can represent different size, partitioning and failure states of composite vessel systems at element level. Composite vessel failure involving high number of pressurized cracks and delaminations as well as their interaction is modelled, and burst pressures are predicted for different vessel systems. The proposed numerical framework can be used towards designing more damage-tolerant vessels critical for the sustainable propulsion technologies.}
