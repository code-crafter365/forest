abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown great potential in solving partial differential equations, yet encounter challenges in accurately capturing the inherent discontinuities of fracture mechanics, such as crack surfaces, material interfaces, and evolving crack fronts. To address this challenge, we propose Discontinuity-Embedded Neural Networks (DENNs). This novel framework explicitly describes strong and weak discontinuities through functions derived from signed distance fields. By embedding these functions into the input space of neural networks, DENNs can naturally capture discontinuous mechanical behaviors without the need for domain decomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DENNs achieve enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy in modeling crack-tip singularities, bimaterial interface cracks, intersecting cracks, and crack propagation. Compared to conventional domain decomposition-based PINNs, DENNs eliminate auxiliary loss terms required to handle discontinuities across subdomains, thereby circumventing issues such as intractable hyperparameter tuning, training instability, and computational overhead. By unifying discontinuity modeling within a mesh-free, physics-informed architecture, DENNs advance the application of physics-informed machine learning in fracture mechanics, establishing a robust and promising framework for forward simulation, inverse analysis, and surrogate modeling of discontinuity-driven phenomena.}
