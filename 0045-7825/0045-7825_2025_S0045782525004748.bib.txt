abstract = {Multiscale structures can be widely observed in nature and exhibit exceptional performance. To design such structures with affordable computational effort, the multiscale concurrent topology optimization (MCTO) paradigm decouples the design process into interconnected macroscopic and microscopic parts through the homogenization method. Within this paradigm, two interpolation methods can be used to describe multiple microstructure distributions on the macroscale, namely, the predefined-region-based and the multi-material-based. However, these two methods appear to be independent in previous studies. In this work, to combine the advantages of both methods, a movable partition region strategy with multiple connectable microstructures is proposed based on the material-field series expansion (MFSE) model. By introducing partitioning design variables and a piecewise distance projection function, the macroscopic distribution of different microstructures can be evolved during the MCTO process. Benefiting from the spatial correlation in the MFSE model, the connectivity between various microstructures is well-ensured by our proposed modified microstructural connectivity approach. Meanwhile, the significant reduction of design variables improves the optimization efficiency, allowing a multiscale concurrent design problem for a 2D case to be solved in just a few minutes. Furthermore, to facilitate real-world applications of the MCTO paradigm, a voxelization method combined with the multiresolution approach for arbitrary design domains is proposed. Several 2D/3D examples are presented, featuring movable partitions and multiple connectable microstructures to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a result, the performance of the optimized result is improved by up to 17 % compared to the classical predefined-region-based MCTO method, and achieves a comparable performance to the multi-material-based MCTO method.}
