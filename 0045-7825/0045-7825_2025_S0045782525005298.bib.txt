abstract = {This work explores the use of the Empirical Interscale Finite Element Method (EIFEM) as a novel preconditioner for iterative solvers in the linear elastic regime. Originally developed as a multiscale Reduced Order Model (ROM), EIFEM captures the kinematics of a unit cell and leverages static condensation with a reduced basis to construct a coarse approximation. We integrate EIFEM as a coarse space within a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver, incorporating pre- and post-smoothing steps. Numerical experiments confirm that EIFEM-based preconditioning significantly reduces iteration counts, particularly for near-solid structures. Although non-solid structures also benefit from reduced iteration counts, the convergence rate is lower compared to solid or nearly-solid cases. This behavior stems from the sensitivity of the solver to the accuracy of the ROM approximation, and we show discontinuous edge functions and discuss other potential strategies as a way to enhance this accuracy. In terms of scalability, the preconditioner is robust, maintaining a nearly constant iteration count as the problem size increases. This work is the first application of EIFEM for preconditioning purposes, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and efficient preconditioner for iterative solvers in 2D and 3D geometries.}
