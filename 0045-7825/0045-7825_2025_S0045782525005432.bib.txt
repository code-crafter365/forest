abstract = {A novel nonlocal peridynamics contact model, which guarantees conservation of angular momentum, is proposed for addressing the contact problems during crack propagation. The algorithms for normal vector computation, contact initiation conditions, and contact type evaluation are described in detail. The numerical examples, including two plates with a vertical contact surface, and the specimen containing one or two pre-existing fissures are successfully studied to validate the proposed contact model. The numerical results reveal that the proposed contact model properly captures the contact behavior during crack propagation. Furthermore, it improves the accuracy of numerical simulations of fracture in materials containing defects.}
