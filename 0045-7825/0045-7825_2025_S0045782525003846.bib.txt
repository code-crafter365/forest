abstract = {Non-Crimp Fabrics (NCF) are advanced fibrous reinforcements characterized by reduced fiber waviness, offering superior mechanical performance compared to woven or braided fabrics. However, their stitching-dependent cohesion makes them prone to inter-ply slippage, posing significant challenges in material forming simulations. While extensive research has been conducted on shear behavior and stitching effects, inter-ply slippage remains underexplored due to the computational demands of existing numerical strategies. Most models use Lagrangian approaches at various scales, micro, meso, and macro, relying on structural or solid elements to represent fibers, rovings, and plies. These methods, though insightful, suffer from high computational costs and difficulties in quantifying relative displacements between constituents. This study proposes a novel Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) modeling framework for NCFs at the ply scale to overcome these limitations. The ALE approach simplifies ply–ply contact management and introduces a continuous scalar field to measure inter-ply slippage. A linear triangular ALE element is formulated and constitutes the base of the ALE model of NCF. A void-ALE extension of the ALE triangle is presented to handle material boundaries embedded in the same spatial configuration. Simulations of bias-extension test and forming on a hemisphere are addressed to demonstrate the ability of the model to capture inter-ply slippage.}
