abstract = {The Physics-informed neural network method (PINN) has shown promise in resolving unknown physical fields in solid mechanics, owing to its success in solving various partial differential equations. Nonetheless, effectively solving engineering-scale boundary value problems, particularly heterogeneity and path-dependent elastoplasticity, remains challenging for PINN. To address these issues, this study proposes a hybrid computational framework integrating finite element method (FEM) with PINN, known as FEINN. This framework employs finite elements for domain discretization instead of collocation points and utilizes the Gaussian integration scheme and strain-displacement matrix to establish the weak-form governing equation instead of the automatic differentiation operator. By harnessing the strengths of FEM and PINN, this framework exhibits inherent advantages in handling complex boundary conditions with heterogeneous materials. For addressing path-dependent elastoplasticity in material nonlinear boundary value problems, an incremental scheme is developed to accurately compute the stress. To validate the effectiveness of FEINN, five types of numerical experiments are conducted, involving homogenous and heterogeneous problems with various boundaries such as concentrated force, distributed force, and distributed displacement. Both linear elastic and elastoplastic (modified cam-clay) models are employed and evaluated. Using the solutions obtained from FEM as a reference, FEINN demonstrates exceptional accuracy and convergence rate in all experiments compared with previous PINNs. The mean absolute percentage errors between FEINN and FEM are consistently below 1%, and FEINN exhibits notably faster convergence rates than PINNs, highlighting its computational efficiency. Moreover, this study discusses the biases observed in regions of low stress and displacement, factors influencing FEINN's performance, and the potential applications of the FEINN framework.}
