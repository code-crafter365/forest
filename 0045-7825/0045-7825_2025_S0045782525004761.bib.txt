abstract = {This paper presents a numerical framework employing the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) for efficiently solving ultrasonic guided wave modal scattering problems and constructing scattering matrices (S-matrices). The framework integrates hierarchical octree meshing and an enhanced far field formulation. It incorporates boundary integrals, enabling an accurate representation of defect interactions with guided waves. Validation is performed using a benchmark test supported by an error estimation method based on energy balance. Two practical examples are used to showcase the simulation framework, where the scattering of guided waves with surface-breaking and subsurface cracks near rivet holes is studied.}
