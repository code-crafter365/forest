abstract = {In this work we develop and analyze a Reynolds-semi-robust and pressure-robust Hybrid High-Order (HHO) discretization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Reynolds-semi-robustness refers to the fact that, under suitable regularity assumptions, the right-hand side of the velocity error estimate does not depend on the inverse of the viscosity. This property is obtained here through a penalty term which involves a subtle projection of the convective term on a subgrid space constructed element by element. Moreover, a method has the pressure-robustness property when it guarantees velocity error estimates that are independent of the pressure. The estimated convergence order for the L∞(L2)- and L2(energy)-norm of the velocity is hk+12, which matches the best results for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods and corresponds to the one expected for HHO methods in convection-dominated regimes. Two-dimensional numerical results on a variety of polygonal meshes complete the exposition.}
