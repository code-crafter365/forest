abstract = {Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) methods have been widely used in solid mechanics to address complex homogenization problems. However, current FFT-based methods face challenges that limit their applicability to intricate material models or complex mechanical problems. These challenges include the manual implementation of constitutive laws and the use of computationally expensive and complex algorithms to couple microscale mechanisms to macroscale material behavior. Here, we incorporate automatic differentiation (AD) within the FFT framework to mitigate these challenges. We demonstrate that AD-enhanced FFT-based methods can derive stress and tangent stiffness directly from energy density functionals, facilitating the extension of FFT-based methods to more intricate material models. Additionally, automatic differentiation simplifies the calculation of homogenized tangent stiffness for microstructures with complex architectures and constitutive properties. This enhancement renders current FFT-based methods more modular, enabling them to tackle homogenization in complex multiscale systems, especially those involving multiphysics processes. Furthermore, we illustrate the use of the AD-enhanced FFT method for problems that extend beyond homogenization, such as uncertainty quantification and topology optimization where automatic differentiation simplifies the computation of sensitivities. Our work will simplify the numerical implementation of FFT-based methods for complex solid mechanics problems.}
