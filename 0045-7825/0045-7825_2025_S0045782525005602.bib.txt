abstract = {The superior stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight mechanical advantages of stamping thin-walled structures can be fully exploited through concurrent design of shape and topology. The existing optimization methods utilize CAD-driven parametric models for thin-walled structural description for dimensionality reduction, which inherently limits the degree of freedom of structural design. To fully exploit the design freedom, a parameter-free concurrent shape and topology optimization method is proposed for stamping thin-walled structures using solid-element density filtering. For shape description, a two-step anisotropic-isotropic filtering and projection scheme is developed for differentiable uniform mid-surface extraction, in which the first used for stamping sheet description while the second for uniform thickness control. For topology description, anisotropic and isotropic filter are employed to achieve manufacturability-oriented designs with uniform thickness and unidirectional holes, and performance-optimized designs with variable thickness and multidirectional holes, respectively. A coupled material interpolation model is established to map the parametric model into the physical model, and a concurrent optimization framework is formulated to update the shape and topology variables simultaneously. Corresponding sensitivities of compliance and volume constraints with respect to shape and topology variables are derived, which will be employed into the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) to solve the optimization model efficiently. Several 3D numerical examples and one vehicle B-pillar structural design problem are presented to systematically validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}
