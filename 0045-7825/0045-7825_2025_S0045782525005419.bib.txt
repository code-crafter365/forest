abstract = {This work presents a high order immersed finite difference method to discretize 2D linear and non-linear elasticity problems on regular Cartesian grids. Our demonstrations show up to sixth order convergence for the displacement field and boundary traction distribution in 2D discretizations of linear and nonlinear elasticity, which incorporate displacement or traction boundary conditions, material interfaces, and spatially-variable and discontinuous material properties. To demonstrate geometric flexibility the convergence results are obtained with non-convex test geometries, and both the linear and nonlinear elasticity discretizations are applied successfully to a complex lattice structure. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of our method to match, locally, the accuracy of a finite element simulation on intricate single- and multi-material elasticity problems. The ability to generate high-fidelity results without manual mesh generation opens opportunities in optimization and data-driven machine learning, as well as physical applications such as elastodynamics and fluid-structure interactions.}
