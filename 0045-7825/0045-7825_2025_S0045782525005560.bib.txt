abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence to partial differential equations has gained significant attention, especially with the rise of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recent advancements in graph-based data further highlight the potential of combining Graph Neural Networks with PINNs, offering a promising approach to solve differential equations by leveraging the strengths of both techniques. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning method, Physics-Enhanced Graph Transformer Model, to solve fracture problems described by the phase-field method (PFM). In the proposed model, the physical system is represented as graph data, with attention mechanisms integrated to improve its efficiency, robustness and accuracy. Then, a neural network based incremental solver is designed for the phase-field variable, addressing the difficulty of incorporating an irreversible function into the phase-field model. Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms PINNs in both computational efficiency and accuracy, exhibiting strong robustness across various fracture scenarios.}
