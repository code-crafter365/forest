abstract = {The modern digital engineering design often requires costly repeated simulations for different scenarios. The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. RBFs offer good approximation properties and are typically computationally fast. The KAN architecture, combined with RBFs, allows DeepOKANs to represent better intricate relationships between input parameters and output fields, resulting in more accurate predictions across various mechanics problems. Specifically, we evaluate DeepOKAN’s performance on several mechanics problems, including 1D sinusoidal waves, 2D orthotropic elasticity, and transient Poisson’s problem, consistently achieving lower training losses and more accurate predictions compared to traditional DeepONets. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.}
