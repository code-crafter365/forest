abstract = {Simulating spatiotemporal turbulence with high fidelity remains a cornerstone challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to its intricate multiscale nature and prohibitive computational demands. Traditional approaches typically employ closure models, which attempt to represent small-scale features in an unresolved manner. However, these methods often sacrifice accuracy and lose high-frequency/wavenumber information, especially in scenarios involving complex flow physics. In this paper, we introduce an innovative neural differentiable modeling framework designed to enhance the predictability and efficiency of spatiotemporal turbulence simulations. Our approach features differentiable hybrid modeling techniques that seamlessly integrate deep neural networks with numerical PDE solvers within a differentiable programming framework, synergizing deep learning with physics-based CFD modeling. Specifically, a hybrid differentiable neural solver is constructed on a coarser grid to capture large-scale turbulent phenomena, followed by the application of a Bayesian conditional diffusion model that generates small-scale turbulence conditioned on large-scale flow predictions. Two innovative hybrid architecture designs are studied, and their performance is evaluated through comparative analysis against conventional large eddy simulation techniques with physics-based subgrid-scale closures and purely data-driven neural solvers. The findings underscore the potential of the neural differentiable modeling framework to significantly enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of turbulence simulations. This study not only demonstrates the efficacy of merging deep learning with physics-based numerical solvers but also sets a new precedent for advanced CFD modeling techniques, highlighting the transformative impact of differentiable programming in scientific computing.}
