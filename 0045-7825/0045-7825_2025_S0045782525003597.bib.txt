abstract = {In engineering structures and mechanical systems, the arrangement of supports or Dirichlet boundary conditions determines the constraint conditions and the distribution of degrees of freedom, thereby exerting a critical influence on performances. This paper proposes a novel integrated design method for structures and supports. First, a hybrid explicit–implicit topology description framework is developed by combining the projection-based moving morphable components (PMMC) method with the parametric level set method to represent the geometric of supports and host structures. Second, to achieve variable Dirichlet boundary conditions, a PMMC-based weighted interpolation method (PMMC-WIM) is introduced to locally penalize the displacement field within finite element implementations. This method enables the synergistic evolution of structural topology along with the position and orientation of support components, while achieving a customizable, smooth, and clearly defined representation of engineering supports. The extended finite element method (XFEM) is employed to capture the physical boundaries, eliminating the need for conforming meshes or remeshing, and thereby improving the accuracy of both structural response and sensitivity analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of numerical examples.}
