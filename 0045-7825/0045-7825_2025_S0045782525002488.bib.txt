abstract = {This paper presents a novel space–time isogeometric topology optimization (ITO) framework for additive manufacturing, enabling concurrent optimization of structural shape and fabrication sequence with accurate geometric representation. The method integrates a density distribution function with a pseudo-time function to optimize build sequences for complex structures, with an objective function that minimizes compliance under external loads and accounts for self-weight effects during fabrication. Density values and virtual heat conduction coefficients are defined at B-spline control points to serve as design variables. A heat conduction-based formulation is employed to generate the pseudo-time function so that prevents the generation of isolated or floating material regions. A layer thickness constraint, defined by the pseudo-time gradient, further enhances manufacturability. The approach has been validated in 2D and 3D examples, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing objectives of entire structure’s stiffness and self-weight of intermediate structures.}
