abstract = {The optimal design of continuous fiber reinforced composites (CFRC) is crucial for enhancing the lightweight and mechanical performance of high-end equipment structures. This research introduces an innovative parallel optimization framework, referred to as level-set and stream function based parallel topology optimization (LSPTO), for optimizing CFRC structures. In LSPTO, the level-set function and stream function are well integrated to calculate the structural topology and continuous fiber paths, respectively. Compactly supported radial basis functions are utilized to parameterize the structural description functions, enabling the development of design variables. Building on LSPTO, this article presents a general form of sensitivity information. This aids in addressing optimization of the design of CFRC across various objectives. Stiffness optimization cases demonstrate the effectiveness of LSPTO and its advantages in computational efficiency. This parallel numerical framework can efficiently produce clear structural topologies and high-quality fiber paths (e.g., continuous, smooth, non-crossing, and of equal width). Further, the extensibility of the LSPTO framework is investigated considering manufacturing constraints (i.e., fiber paths spacing and fiber volume fraction) for practical applications, i.e., additive manufacturing. By incorporating two constraints related to the gradient of the stream function into the LSPTO framework, the controllable fiber path spacing, regulation of fiber volume fraction, and variable fiber density of CFRC can be well achieved. Compared with the recently developed uniform fiber density method, LSPTO can attain a more effective distribution of fiber paths and significantly enhance structural performance while adhering to manufacturing constraints. The proposed method is highly efficient and easily extensible in the design of CFRC and lays a foundation in the integrated design and manufacturing of CFRC.}
