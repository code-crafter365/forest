abstract = {Shallow water equations (SWE) are fundamental nonlinear hyperbolic PDE-based models in fluid dynamics that are essential for studying a wide range of geophysical and engineering phenomena. Therefore, stable and accurate numerical methods for SWE are needed. Although some algorithms are well studied for deterministic SWE, more effort should be devoted to handling the SWE with uncertainty. In this paper, we incorporate uncertainty through a stochastic Galerkin (SG) framework, and building on an existing hyperbolicity-preserving SG formulation for 2D SWE, we construct the corresponding entropy flux pair, and develop structure-preserving, well-balanced, second-order energy conservative and energy stable finite volume schemes for the SG formulation of the two-dimensional shallow water system. We demonstrate the efficacy, applicability, and robustness of these structure-preserving algorithms through several challenging numerical experiments.}
