abstract = {The proposed two-dimensional geometrically exact beam element extends our previous work by including the effects of shear distortion, and also of distributed forces and moments acting along the beam. The general flexibility-based formulation exploits the kinematic equations combined with the inverted sectional equations and the integrated form of equilibrium equations. The resulting set of three first-order differential equations is discretized by finite differences and the boundary value problem is converted into an initial value problem using the shooting method. Due to the special structure of the governing equations, the scheme remains explicit even though the first derivatives are approximated by central differences, leading to high accuracy. The main advantage of the adopted approach is that the error can be efficiently reduced by refining the computational grid used for finite differences at the element level while keeping the number of global degrees of freedom low. The efficiency is also increased by dealing directly with the global centerline coordinates and sectional inclination with respect to global axes as the primary unknowns at the element level, thereby avoiding transformations between local and global coordinates. Two formulations of the sectional equations, namely the widely used Reissner model and a less common version referred to as the Ziegler model, are presented and compared. In particular, stability of an axially loaded beam/column is investigated and the connections to the Haringx and Engesser stability theories are discussed. Both approaches are tested in a series of numerical examples, which illustrate (i) high accuracy with quadratic convergence when the spatial discretization is refined, (ii) easy modeling of variable stiffness along the element (such as rigid joint offsets), (iii) efficient and accurate characterization of the buckling and post-buckling behavior.}
