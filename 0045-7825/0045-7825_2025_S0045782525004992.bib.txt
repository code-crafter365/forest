abstract = {Isogeometric analysis is employed in a finite-element framework to analyze the thermo-mechanical response of curved shells in sintered contact. A mathematical formulation is first derived from the generalized viewpoint of deformational mechanics with higher gradients and then linked to classic shell theory. This formulation extends classic shell theory, since it also covers additional deformation modes such as those related to in-plane gradient-elasticity. The finite element formulation of this model is based on the isogeometric analysis in combination with NURBS. It is especially well-suited for the computation of second gradients and allows an accurate representation of both sphere and sinter curvature. The first numerical example is a single hollow thermo-elastic sphere. Various transient thermal and mechanical boundary conditions trigger deformation modes that range from kinks to oblate shapes and wrinkles. Two sintered hollow spheroids are then used as a representative minimal system for hollow-sphere structures that are known for their opportunities in light-weight design and thermal insulation. Sinter radius and spheroid (aspect) radius can distinctively tune density, stiffness and thermal conduction, which mainly depends on whether wall stretching or bending dominates. The sinter contact complements reinforced plates and cutouts by new constraints and options for thermo-elastic transfer. While the isogeometric analysis remains beneficial to accurately capture the curved features, the spheroids’ two principal curvatures and the curvature of the sinter area yield competing requirements for the resolution of the isogeometric discretization.}
