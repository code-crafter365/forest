abstract = {In this work, we introduce two innovative types of discontinuity-removing physics-informed neural networks (DR-PINNs) aimed at solving variable coefficient elliptic interface problems on curved surfaces, i.e., decoupling DR-PINN and coupling DR-PINN. Initially, by leveraging the level set function associated with the surface, we reframe the surface differential operators as conventional differential operators within the framework of Eulerian coordinates. The resultant solution is divided into two parts: continuous and discontinuous components, which are each approximated using separate neural network surrogates that can be trained independently or together. The decoupling DR-PINN utilizes a sequential training procedure for the two components. The first neural network focuses on the discontinuous part and pre-trains on solution jumps to facilitate the learning of the complementary PDE conditions by the subsequent network. This decoupling strategy relies heavily on the cusp-enforced level set function of the interface, which may lead to inefficiencies since the training process is separated into two distinct stages. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coupling approach of the DR-PINNs, in which both components simultaneously learn complementary conditions within a unified network, thereby removing the requirement for cusp-enforcing level set functions of the interface. Ultimately, we perform numerical experiments to validate the precision and effectiveness of both types of DR-PINNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on neural networks to solve surface interface problems.}
