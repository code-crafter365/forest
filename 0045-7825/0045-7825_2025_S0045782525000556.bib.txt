abstract = {Crystal growth processes and the Czochralski process in particular involves various physical phenomena such as heat transfer, phase change or liquid flows and requires a coupled multiphysical model for realistic numerical simulations. In this work, a new and extendable model is developed using the open-source software FEniCS. Basic equations for electromagnetic induction, heat conduction and radiation as well as phase change are thoroughly derived up to a finite element form and discussed together with the assumed boundary conditions and approximations. Verification of the FEniCS model with an analytical case demonstrated an accuracy with an error below 1%. A comparison with experimental results and numerical data from a similar model achieved a good agreement and showed opportunities for further improvement of melt flow modeling in particular.}
