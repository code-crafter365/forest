abstract = {We revisit finite element discretizations of the Reissner-Mindlin plate in the case of non-simply connected (holey) domains with mixed boundary conditions. Guided by the de Rham complex, we develop conditions under which schemes deliver locking-free, optimal rates of convergence. We naturally recover the typical assumptions arising for clamped, simply supported plates. More importantly, we also see new conditions arise naturally from the presence of holes in the domain or in the case of mixed boundary conditions. We show that, fortunately, many of the existing popularly used schemes do, in fact, satisfy all of the conditions, and thus are locking-free.}
