abstract = {Excessive habitual loading can cause microcracks in cortical bone, which are self-repaired through remodelling. The flexoelectric effect—electric potential generation due to inhomogeneous deformation—plays a key role in coordinating cellular healing activities. Based on McBride et al. (2020) and Titlbach et al. (2023), we propose a micromorphic framework that incorporates nonlinear electroelastic and flexoelectric contributions into the constitutive equations to determine the electric potential at a microcrack tip and, crucially, its impact on bone healing, which is captured through changes in nominal bone density. The framework is assessed using a prototypical cracked cantilever bone sample. Results demonstrate the model’s ability to capture enhanced growth due to the flexoelectric effect and is complemented by a detailed analysis of the relevant material parameters.}
