abstract = {Multi-material topology optimization as a research hotspot has been widely investigated and all the reported multi-material interpolation models add m or m-1 design variables/level set equations to handle m levels or phases and the number of design variables is proportional to the number of material type. The current single variable interpolation model as an attractive alternative selection often leads to the emergence of interphase enclosed within the adjacent materials which excessively restricts the design space, resulting in a suboptimal solution and consequently placing limitations on the potential realistic application. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, a pioneering framework by incorporating the univariate characteristic function into the Discrete Material Optimization (DMO) scheme for the first time is proposed for both structured grids and unstructured meshes. Firstly, the univariate characteristic function is devised to transform the original single design variable field into a set of topology density functions, each independently controlling single material topology. The smoothing mechanism using the Helmholtz Partial Differential Equation (PDE) filter is applied for each topology density function field to ensure spatial correlation and continuity of single material distribution. Each filtered topology density field is in turn passed to a regularized Heaviside projection function that generates physical density field for a continuous representation of non-existence or existence for each material. All the resulting physical topology density fields ranging from 0 to 1 are then subsequently integrated to construct a composite interpolation model by virtue of the DMO scheme, preventing material overlaps due to the Helmholtz PDE filtering. The design variables allotted to nodes are updated using the method of moving asymptotes. An adaptive continuation strategy is introduced to adjust the projection slope and penalization parameters, enhancing optimization efficiency and accelerating optimization simulation. Finally, extensive numerical experiments including two practical real-world engineering examples are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed method works well for both structured and unstructured meshes, while inheriting the benefits and favourable properties of both the univariate characteristic function and the DMO scheme, effectively addressing material envelope bottlenecks and reducing excessive design variables. The proposed approach offers a well-founded and flexible platform for solving multi-material topology optimization problems, making the approach practical for real-world engineering scenarios.}
