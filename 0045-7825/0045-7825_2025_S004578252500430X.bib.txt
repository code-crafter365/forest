abstract = {Topology optimization often faces challenges such as ill-posedness, grayscale, and checkerboard patterns in structural modeling, as well as multimodality and the curse of dimensionality in optimal solution searches. This study proposes a method that simultaneously addresses these challenges to achieve a high-performing optimal configuration without the need for burdensome tasks, such as initial guessing and strategy parameter adjustments. The method employs accurate structural boundary modeling using a body-fitted mesh generated along iso-surfaces of level-set function parameterized by B-splines, providing a precise analysis of the physical field. By replacing the design variables of the discretized level-set function with B-spline control points, the number of design variables reduces significantly without compromising the accuracy of finite-element analyses. This reduction allows for the use of optimizers such as evolutionary strategies, which typically struggle with the curse of dimensionality, but are robust against the challenges. The covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is employed as the optimizer for efficient and robust solution searching, implemented with box constraint handling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we address three design problems manipulating different physical phenomena: minimizing mean compliance, designing thermal carpet cloaking, and optimizing the topology of a light-source shifter for optical location camouflage. For each optimization problem, the proposed method accelerated convergence to well-performing optimal configurations without the need for trial and error in guessing initial solutions or adjusting strategy parameters. The level-set method with B-spline parametrization enables CMA-ES to obtain an optimal configuration with better or comparable performance in approximately 2.6% to 73% of the optimization steps, compared with the CMA-ES-based level-set method without parametrization.}
