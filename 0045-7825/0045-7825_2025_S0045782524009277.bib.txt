abstract = {Topology optimization (TO) has significant potential for industrial applications and offers greater design freedom than size or shape optimization. However, currently the design result of topology optimization is difficult to be directly applied to industrial design and manufacturing. The reason is that, at present, the optimal topologies produced by the most popular topology optimization methods lack explicit and computer-aided design (CAD) friendly representation. The triangular mesh derived from the smoothed results of topology optimization by conventional post-processing exhibits a high density of patches with low quality, making them difficult to edit and lacking in parameter control. This paper presents a general framework and method for automatically and self-adaptively reconstructing CAD models from complex topology optimization results. Firstly, a routine surface smoothing on the topology optimization results is performed to generate a triangular mesh. Then the Instant-Meshes and the generalized motorcycle graphs method are introduced for surface quadrilateral processing of the triangular mesh and generation of the sparse quadrilateral layouts. The improved harmonic mapping and adaptive sampling methods are developed to deal with each quadrilateral layout to generate non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) expression, and finally result in a smooth, explicit, and easy to edit boundary representation (B-Rep) model. A multi-resolution control strategy is proposed to significantly reduce the number of control points of NURBS patches. A highly efficient parameter domain initialization approach for harmonic mapping is presented using geodesic distance. The proposed framework and methods have been modularized and implemented in Python. The Python code (PYTOCAD) and all the testing models are available for download on https://github.com/rhy-thu/AMRTO. Various 3D examples including metamaterial designs with complex topology optimization results are tested to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the method. The developed program based on the present method requires less manual operation, thus paving the way for the automatic connection between topology optimization and CAD. Compared with commercial software, our method significantly reduces the number of NURBS patches, control points, and model file size of CAD model generated.}
