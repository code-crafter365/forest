abstract = {This paper presents a novel Parametrically Upscaled Coupled Constitutive Damage Mechanics (PUCCDM) model for efficient multiscale-multiphysics analysis of piezoelectric composites, coupling finite deformation electromechanical and damage fields. The thermodynamically consistent PUCCDM model provides the macroscopic constitutive response with explicit links to the underlying microstructural morphology characterized by Representative Aggregated Microstructural Parameters (RAMPs). The composite material in this study is constituted of unidirectional piezoelectric fibers nonuniformly distributed in a passive polymer matrix, for which the RAMPs are optimally represented by the fiber volume fraction and principal components of the 2-point correlation functions. The PUCCDM model development requires a microstructural response database (MRDB) generated by finite deformation, electromechanical phase field simulations of the microstructure-based Statistically Equivalent Representative Volume Elements (M-SERVEs), capturing interfacial debonding and matrix cracking. Machine learning tools like ANN operate on the MRDB to express the PUCCDM constitutive parameters as explicit functions of the RAMPs. The PUCCDM model is implemented within a nonlocal finite element framework for efficient mesh-insensitive simulations of macroscopic piezoelectric behavior undergoing damage. Numerical examples show the ability of the PUCCDM model to capture the influence of RAMPs on the overall electromechanical response and damage evolution, demonstrating its potential for reliable and tractable multiscale analysis of multifunctional composite structures.}
