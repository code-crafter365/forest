abstract = {In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for the identification of the parameters of nonlinear constitutive material laws using full-field displacement measurements. The concept of force-based Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU-F) is employed, which relies on the availability of measurable quantities such as displacements and external forces. The proposed approach particularly unfolds the advantage of FEMU-F, as opposed to the conventional FEMU, by directly incorporating information from full-field measured displacements into the model. This feature is well-suited for heterogeneous materials with softening, where the localization zone depends on the random microstructure. Besides, to account for uncertainties in the measured displacements, we treat displacements as additional unknown variables to be identified, alongside the constitutive parameters. A variational Bayesian scheme is then employed to identify these unknowns via approximate posteriors under the assumption of multivariate normal distributions. An optimization problem is then formulated and solved iteratively, aiming to minimize the discrepancy between true and approximate posteriors. The benefit of the proposed approach lies in the stochastic nature of the formulation, which allows to tackle uncertainties related to model parameters and measurement noise. We verify the efficacy of our proposed framework on two simulated examples using gradient damage model with a path-dependent nonlinear constitutive law. Based on a nonlocal equivalent strain norm, this constitutive model can simulate a localized damage zone representing softening and cracking. The first example illustrates an application of the FEMU-F approach to cracked structures including sensitivity studies related to measurement noise and parameters of the prior distributions. In this example, the variational Bayesian solver demonstrates a sizable advantage in terms of computational efficiency compared to a traditional least-square optimizer. The second example demonstrates a sub-domain analysis to tackle challenges associated with limited domain knowledge such as uncertain boundary conditions.}
