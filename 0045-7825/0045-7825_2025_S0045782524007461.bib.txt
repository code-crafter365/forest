abstract = {Double–Double (DD) laminates, incorporating a repetition of sub-plies featuring two groups of balanced angles, offer broad design flexibility together with the ease of design and manufacturing. In this work, a novel optimization design method is proposed for DD composite laminates based on multi-material topology optimization. First, the uniform multiple laminates interpolation (UMLI) model is proposed to describe the certainty of the stacking direction in multi-layer composite structures, inspired by the interpolation model in multi-material topology optimization. Specifically, the stiffness matrices of all alternative angle combinations of laminates are interpolated to form virtual laminates. The UMLI model eliminates the need for adding interlayer constraints during the optimization process. Then, the optimization problem is defined to minimize the compliance of the composite structures and is solved using the gradient-based optimization algorithm. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the design of the composite stiffened panel, the composite Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) wing, and the rear fuselage. The results demonstrate that the UMLI model and proposed optimization method have considerable potential in the angle optimization design of multi-layer structures.}
