abstract = {In this paper, a time-dependent reliability-based double-scale topology optimization (TO) framework considering manufacturability is proposed. The proposed TO model focuses on the structural transient dynamic performance subjected to general dynamic loads. A time-dependent interval non-probabilistic reliability theory based on the idea of first-passage is introduced into the double-scale TO model to assess the structural performance reliability over the time course of interest. To accommodate the gradient algorithm, a portion of the interval process time-dependent reliability metrics are reconstructed in this paper. Combined with a density-projection length scale control method, a weight reduction concurrent TO process for double-scale structures considering structural dynamic compliance and manufacturability is constructed. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed TO methodology.}
