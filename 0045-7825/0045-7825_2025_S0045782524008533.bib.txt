abstract = {The original computational framework of elasto-plastic localizing gradient damage, also called as the localizing gradient plasticity (LGP) model, considers that damage in a material causes reduction of yield strength alone. It does not account for the physical process of stiffness-degradation due to damage of ductile materials. Therefore, in this work, a new constitutive model of elasto-plastic localizing gradient damage is developed which incorporates the effect of damage on stiffness as well as yield strength. A thermodynamic basis is provided for the model through the law of energy-balance. Constitutive relations are developed in variational form and incorporated into a finite element framework which has fully-coupling between deformations and non-local equivalent plastic strains. Damage is induced in the material by these non-local strains. Moreover, the original localizing gradient plasticity model suffers from oscillating stress fields in its computations. To counter this issue, an anisotropic form of non-local averaging is used in the present work. Accordingly, a smoothed stress-based gradient matrix is used to model the non-local interaction region. The capability of the present model is investigated through several problems of ductile fracture and compared with the conventional model and some experimental evidences. It is observed that the proposed model satisfactorily captures the material-softening induced by damage.}
