abstract = {Many real-world applications demand accurate and fast predictions, as well as reliable uncertainty estimates. However, quantifying uncertainty on high-dimensional predictions is still a severely under-investigated problem, especially when input–output relationships are non-linear. To handle this problem, the present work introduces an innovative approach that combines autoencoder deep neural networks with the probabilistic regression capabilities of Gaussian processes. The autoencoder provides a low-dimensional representation of the solution space, while the Gaussian process is a Bayesian method that provides a probabilistic mapping between the low-dimensional inputs and outputs. We validate the proposed framework for its application to surrogate modeling of non-linear finite element simulations. Our findings highlight that the proposed framework is computationally efficient as well as accurate in predicting non-linear deformations of solid bodies subjected to external forces, all the while providing insightful uncertainty assessments.}
