abstract = {In recent years, the architected structures have attracted extensive attention due to their lightweight feature and excellent mechanical properties. The development of additive manufacturing technologies has expedited the development of the computational design of architected structures. However, the parametric design and simulation of architected structures are full of challenges because of their complex topology and intricate geometrical shapes. In this paper, a four-step construction method is developed for the parametric design of architected shell structures from the given curve, surface, or solid, by using unstructured T-splines. The four-step method comprises segmentation, positioning, mapping, and merging. A unit cell is first designed using an unstructured T-spline and then mapped to the macro geometry. For curve-based design, a rotation-minimizing frame is utilized to guide the design of an architected shell structure from a given macro curve. For surface-based design, the unit cells are mapped to the physical domain spanned by two tangent vectors and the normal vector. For solid-based design, the unit cells are adjusted along the three parametric directions of the trivariate solid. A D-patch scheme is employed to construct analysis-suitable unstructured T-splines over the architected grid. The resulting smooth surface model is suitable for Kirchhoff–Love shell analysis, which requires at least C1-continuity across elements. Various architected shell structures are constructed and several numerical examples are investigated to validate the effectiveness of the developed method.}
