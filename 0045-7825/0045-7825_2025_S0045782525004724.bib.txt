abstract = {This study presents an advanced numerical framework that integrates experimentally acquired Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) data into high-fidelity simulations for adhesive rough contact problems, bridging the gap between experimental physics and computational mechanics. The proposed approach extends the eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness (MPJR) interface finite element method to incorporate both surface topography and spatially varying adhesion properties, imported directly from AFM measurements. The adhesion behavior is modeled using a modified Lennard-Jones potential, which is locally parameterized based on the AFM-extracted adhesion peak force and energy dissipation data. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through 2D and 3D finite element simulations of a heterogeneous PS-LDPE (polystyrene matrix with low-density polyethylene inclusions) sample, where the bulk elastic properties are also experimentally characterized via AFM. The results highlight the significance of accounting for both surface adhesion variability and material bulk heterogeneity in accurately predicting contact responses.}
