abstract = {Accurate modeling of fluid-particle interactions in geotechnical systems, particularly those involving irregular particles, presents significant challenges in computational mechanics, necessitating a versatile Eulerian-Lagrangian framework capable of handling diverse particle geometries. This paper presents a novel point cloud-based semi-resolved CFD-DEM coupling method to ensure accurate void fraction calculations in fluid fields surrounding particles of arbitrary shapes under arbitrary grid configurations. The method integrates high-precision particle volume sampling via point cloud technology with a Gaussian kernel function for fluid velocity reconstruction, enabling accurate void fraction calculations and robust flow field characterizations. Numerical tests validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating high-quality particle volume mapping and smooth, continuous void fraction distributions. In benchmark cases such as single particle sedimentation, three-phase flow dam breaks, and wave impacts on rock piles, the method shows excellent agreement with experimental data, particularly in capturing fluid-particle interaction forces and interface dynamics. The computational efficiency is significantly enhanced through the incorporation of k-d tree data structures for range searching. It is indicated that the proposed semi-resolved CFD-DEM coupling method provides a new insight and tool for accurate simulation of fluid-particle coupling systems in complex geotechnical engineering problems.}
