abstract = {The enhancement of low-light images remains a prominent focus in the field of image processing. The degree of lightness significantly influences vision-based intelligent recognition and analysis. Departing from conventional methods, this paper proposes an innovative joint spatial-frequency domain network for low-light image enhancement, referred to as JSF. In the spatial domain, brightness is optimized through the amalgamation of global and local information. In the frequency domain, noise is reduced and details are amplified using Fourier Transformation to carry out amplitude and phase enhancement. Additionally, the enhanced results from the aforementioned domains are fused by linear and nonlinear stretching. To validate the effectiveness of JSF, this paper presents both qualitative and quantitative comparison results, demonstrating its superiority over several existing state-of-the-art methods.}
