abstract = {Medical image segmentation is a critical technology that enables medical professional personnels to accurately identify lesions, organs, and other key structures from various medical images. In this area, deep learning-based methods have emerged as the mainstream approach for medical image segmentation. However, the inherent variability in lesion size and spatial dimensions still presents significant challenges for achieving precise medical segmentation, as current dilated convolution-based approaches exhibit limitations in effectively capturing and processing multi-scale pathological features. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the current techniques, this paper proposes a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture, referred to as selective dilated convolution network (SDC-Net), to address the limitations of existing methods in multi-scale feature extraction, detail preservation, and feature fusion. Within the SDC-Net, the selective dilated convolution modules (SDCMs), the wavelet convolution module (WCM), and the feature fusion modules (FFMs) are proposed: The SDCMs capture multi-scale contextual information through cascaded dilated convolutions and dynamic weight adjustment. The WCM extracts multi-spectral features with wavelet transforms, enhancing the capture of complex shapes and boundaries. The FFMs optimize feature fusion with attention mechanisms, improving segmentation accuracy. Through carefully designed comparative experiments, the SDC-Net is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods including CE-Net, CPF-Net and Rolling U-Net, with the metrics of Dice, Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD), and mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) reaching 94.55%, 0.40 pix and 89.57%, 95.21%, 0.29 pix and 91.11%, and 92.05%, 0.59 pix and 86.37%, on three publicly available medical image datasets: ISIC-2018 (melanoma dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (gastrointestinal disease polyp endoscopy) and Figshare (brain tumor magnetic resonance scans), respectively.}
