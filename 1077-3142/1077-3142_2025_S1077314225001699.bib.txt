abstract = {Ataxia is a neurological condition that impairs mobility and independence in daily activities. To mitigate the symptoms, patients often seek physical therapy interventions. However, these therapies can be challenging for some individuals, depending on their level of independence, and patients may experience pain and frustration due to repetitive tasks. To address these limitations, rehabilitation robots, such as the Smart Walker (SW), can be tailored to an individual’ s degree of independence, while Augmented Reality (AR) systems can enhance patient engagement and motivation. However, the use of AR may also lead to adverse effects, such as restrictions in gait patterns and the potential of cybersickness symptoms. In this context, this paper presents a case report of a patient with ataxia to evaluate the effects of the SW and AR in three tasks: Physiotherapist-Assisted Gait (PAG), Walker-Assisted Gait (WAG), and Augmented Reality Walker-Assisted Gait (ARWAG). The results show that the use of the SW in WAG led to improvements in gait parameters, including a 27% increase in step length and a 19% increase in hip excursion in the sagittal plane. In ARWAG, these improvements were even greater, with a 58% increase in step length and a 43% increase in hip excursion in the sagittal plane. No cybersickness symptoms were observed during the ARWAG. Additionally, among all tasks, the patient expressed a preference for the ARWAG, indicating that the combination of SW and AR holds potential benefits for assisting ataxia patients in physical therapy interventions.}
