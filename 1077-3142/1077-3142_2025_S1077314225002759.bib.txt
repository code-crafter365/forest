abstract = {Visible–Infrared Person Re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match the identities of pedestrians captured by non-overlapping cameras in both visible and infrared modalities. The key to overcoming the VI-ReID challenge lies in extracting diverse modality-shared features. Current methods mainly focus on channel-level operations during data preprocessing, with the aim of expanding the dataset. However, these methods often overlook the complex relationships among channel features, leading to insufficient utilization of unique information in each channel. To address this issue, we propose the Channel-Aware Feature Mining Network (CAFMNet) to improve VI-ReID effectiveness. Specifically, we design three core modules: a Channel-Level Feature Optimization (CLFO) module, which captures channel-level key features for identity recognition and directly extracts identity-relevant information at the channel level; a Channel-Level Feature Refinement (CLFR) module, which enhances channel-level features while retaining useful information—addressing the irrelevant content in initially extracted features; a Multi-Dimensional Feature Optimization (MDFO) module, which comprehensively processes multi-dimensional feature information to enhance the model’s ability to understand and describe input data. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01 and LLCM datasets demonstrate that our CAFMNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of VI-ReID effectiveness.
