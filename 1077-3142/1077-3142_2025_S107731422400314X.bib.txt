abstract = {Technologies to enable safe and effective collaboration and coexistence between humans and robots have gained significant importance in the last few years. A critical component useful for realizing this collaborative paradigm is the understanding of human and robot 3D poses using non-invasive systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel vision-based system leveraging depth data to accurately establish the 3D locations of skeleton joints. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Pose Nowcasting, denoting the capability of the proposed system to enhance its current pose estimation accuracy by jointly learning to forecast future poses. The experimental evaluation is conducted on two different datasets, providing accurate and real-time performance and confirming the validity of the proposed method on both the robotic and human scenarios.}
