abstract = {This paper addresses the task of video background music generation, focusing on symbolic music generation. We propose a hybrid modeling approach that jointly considers both long-term and short-term musical structures. While existing research predominantly focuses on long-term patterns in music, the critical role of short-term structures in shaping musical expressiveness has been largely overlooked. Short-term structures provide intrinsic logic and emotional tension through dynamic variations and immediacy, synergizing with long-term structures to form cohesive musical narratives. To this end, we propose the VMM model, which innovatively integrates Mamba and Transformer: the Mamba module is designed to captures long-term dependencies via state space modeling, while the Transformer decodes short-term interactions among local notes through self-attention mechanisms. To further enhance multimodal understanding, we introduce Video-Music Generation Framework (VMGF), which incorporates a Switch Schedule mechanism that dynamically selects fusion strategies between video features and chord features during training and mitigates multimodal representation conflicts through gradient control. Experiments demonstrate that VMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in symbolic music generation tasks, excelling in metrics such as structural coherence and emotional consistency, thereby validating its leading capabilities in the field of symbolic music generation.
