abstract = {Accurate segmentation of hands and interacting objects is a critical challenge in computer vision, attributed to complex factors like mutual occlusion, finger self-similarity, and high hand movement flexibility. To tackle these issues, we present RefineHOS, an innovative framework for precise pixel-level segmentation of hands and interacting objects. Based on RefineMask, RefineHOS features substantial architectural optimizations for hand–object interaction scenarios. Specifically, we designed an Augmentation Feature Pyramid Path module (AFPN) integrated with a Dual Attention module (DAM) in the backbone to capture multi-scale feature information of hands and interacting objects. Additionally, we enhanced segmentation performance by introducing a Triplet Attention module (TAM) to optimize both the mask head and the semantic head. We also presented a new Boundary Refinement Module (BRM), utilizing an iterative subdivision approach to enhance the precision of boundary details in the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (including VISOR, Ego-HOS, and ENIGMA-51) show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. To comprehensively evaluate segmentation quality, we introduce Boundary Average Precision (Boundary AP) as a key metric to complement existing benchmark segmentation metrics.}
