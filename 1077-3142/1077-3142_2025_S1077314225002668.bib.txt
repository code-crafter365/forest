abstract = {Semantic segmentation has achieved an exceptional success in image analysis making it easier to quickly and efficiently understand their content. Although deep learning models have shown exceptional performance in image segmentation, their computational demands restrict the range of devices capable of executing these models. This paper introduces a computationally efficient deep neural network named Extremely Light Unet (XLITE-UNET) as a solution to this challenge. Through the use of axial depthwise and selective atrous convolutions within Unet convolution blocks and the substitution of skip connections with a tiny channel attention (TCA) module, a lightweight and efficient deep convolutional neural network architecture is introduced in this paper. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets including COVID-19 CT scans, Data Science Bowl 2018, Lung Segmentation, PH2 dataset, and CVC-ClinicDB show that our model surpasses existing heavyweights and lightweights segmentation models in several aspects such as: (a) Low computational cost, with floating points operation (FLOP) less than 1.6M; (b) reduced parameter count; (c) best accuracy in cases of small size segments; and (d) compact model size, enabling storage on smaller memory devices.}
