abstract = {Tackling domain and class generalization challenges remains a significant hurdle in the realm of remote sensing (RS). Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have showcased impressive zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities through extensive contrastive training. Existing literature emphasizes prompt learning as a means of enriching prompts with both domain and content information, particularly through smaller learnable projectors, thereby addressing multi-domain data challenges perceptibly. Along with this, it is observed that CLIP’s vision encoder fails to generalize well on the puzzled or corrupted RS images. In response, we propose a novel solution utilizing self-supervised learning (SSL) to ensure consistency for puzzled RS images in domain generalization (DG). This approach strengthens visual features, facilitating the generation of domain-invariant prompts. Our proposed RS3Lip, trained with small projectors featuring few layers, complements the pre-trained CLIP. It incorporates SSL and inpainting losses for visual features, along with a consistency loss between the features of SSL tasks and textual features. Empirical findings demonstrate that RS3Lip consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods across five benchmark optical remote sensing datasets, achieving improvements of at least by 1.3% in domain and class generalization tasks.}
