abstract = {Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis is a challenging task requiring modelling both textual and image domains and their relationship. The substantial improvement in image quality achieved by recent works has paved the way for numerous applications such as language-aided image editing, computer-aided design, text-based image retrieval, and training data augmentation. In this work, we ask a simple question: Along with realistic images, can we obtain any useful by-product (e.g. foreground/background or multi-class segmentation masks, detection labels) in an unsupervised way that will also benefit other computer vision tasks and applications?. In an attempt to answer this question, we explore generating realistic images and their corresponding foreground/background segmentation masks from the given text. To achieve this, we experiment the concept of co-segmentation along with GAN. Specifically, a novel GAN architecture called Co-Segmentation Inspired GAN (COS-GAN) is proposed that generates two or more images simultaneously from different noise vectors and utilises a spatial co-attention mechanism between the image features to produce realistic segmentation masks for each of the generated images. The advantages of such an architecture are two-fold: (1) The generated segmentation masks can be used to focus on foreground and background exclusively to improve the quality of generated images, and (2) the segmentation masks can be used as a training target for other tasks, such as object localisation and segmentation. Extensive experiments conducted on CUB, Oxford-102, and COCO datasets show that COS-GAN is able to improve visual quality and generate reliable foreground/background masks for the generated images.}
