abstract = {This work studies a challenging and practical issue known as multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD). This problem requires only normal images for training while simultaneously testing both normal and anomaly images across multiple classes. Existing reconstruction-based methods typically adopt pyramidal networks as encoders and decoders to obtain multi-resolution features, often involving complex sub-modules with extensive handcraft engineering. In contrast, a plain Vision Transformer (ViT) showcasing a more straightforward architecture has proven effective in multiple domains, including detection and segmentation tasks. It is simpler, more effective, and elegant. Following this spirit, we explore the use of only plain ViT features for MUAD. We first abstract a Meta-AD concept by synthesizing current reconstruction-based methods. Subsequently, we instantiate a novel ViT-based ViTAD structure, designed incrementally from both global and local perspectives. This model provide a strong baseline to facilitate future research. Additionally, this paper uncovers several intriguing findings for further investigation. Finally, we comprehensively and fairly benchmark various approaches using seven metrics and their average. Utilizing a basic training regimen with only an MSE loss, ViTAD achieves state-of-the-art results and efficiency on MVTec AD, VisA, and Uni-Medical datasets. E.g., achieving 85.4 mAD that surpasses UniAD by +3.0 for the MVTec AD dataset, and it requires only 1.1 h and 2.3G GPU memory to complete model training on a single V100 that can serve as a strong baseline to facilitate the development of future research.
