abstract = {Traditional one-stage object detection (OOD) methods often simultaneously perform independent classification (cls) and localization (loc) tasks. As a result, spatial misalignment occurs between the cls and loc results. To address this spatial misalignment issue, a method of novel task-aligned one-stage object detection with interactions between branches (TOODIB) is proposed to learn some interactive features from both tasks and then encourage the features between two forward cls and loc branches to interact. Inspired by a human retina neural network in which lateral paths exist between longitudinal paths, an interaction-between-branches (IBB) module is developed to encourage the interactive features between cls and loc branches to interact. In addition, this paper improves the interactive convolution layers (IICLs) to produce more interactive features and designs a task-related spatial decoupling (TRSD) module to decouple interactive features for specific tasks, thereby providing task-specific features. The MS-COCO2017 dataset is used to evaluate TOODIB. TOODIB significantly reduces the degree of spatial misalignment, and the task misalignment metric decreases from 19.85 to 3.41 pixels. TOODIB also improves one-stage object detection and achieves average precision (AP) values of 43.3 and 47.6 on the ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones, respectively.}
