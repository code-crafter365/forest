abstract = {Camouflage object detection aims to identify concealed objects in images. Global context and local spatial details are crucial for this task. Convolutional neural network (CNN) excels at capturing fine-grained local features, while Transformer is adept at modeling global contextual information. To leverage their respective strengths, we propose a novel CNN-Transformer fusion network (CTF-Net) for COD to achieve more accurate detection. Our approach employs parallel CNN and Transformer branches as an encoder to extract complementary features. We then propose a cross-domain fusion module (CDFM) to fuse these features with cross-modulation. Additionally, we develop a boundary-aware module (BAM) that combines low-level edge details with high-level global context to extract camouflaged object edge features. Furthermore, we design a feature enhancement module (FEM) to mitigate background and noise interference during cross-layer feature fusion, thereby highlighting camouflaged object regions for precise predictions. Extensive experiments show that CTF-Net outperforms the existing 16 state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used COD datasets. Especially, compared with all the comparison models, CTF-Net significantly improves the performance by ∼5.1% (F-measure) on the NC4K dataset, showing that CTF-Net could accurately detect camouflaged objects.
