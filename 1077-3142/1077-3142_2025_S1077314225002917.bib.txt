abstract = {In this paper, we examine the Perspective-3-Point (P3P) problem, which involves determining the absolute pose of a calibrated camera using three known 3D–2D point correspondences. Traditionally, this problem reduces to solving a quartic polynomial. Recently, some cubic formulations based on degenerate conic curves have emerged, offering notable improvements in computational efficiency and avoiding repeated solutions. However, existing cubic formulations typically utilize a two-stage solution framework, which is inherently less efficient and stable compared to the single-stage framework. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel single-stage degenerate-conic-based method. Our core idea is to algebraically and directly formulate the P3P problem as finding the intersection of two degenerate conic curves. Specifically, we first parameterize the rotation matrix and translation vector as linear combinations of three known vectors, leaving only two unknown elements of the rotation matrix. Next, leveraging orthogonality constraints of the rotation matrix, we derive two conic equations. Finally, we efficiently solve these equations under the degenerate condition. Since our method combines advantage of both single-stage approaches and degenerate-conic-based techniques, it is efficient, accurate, and stable. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our method.}
