abstract = {To address the challenge of balancing detection accuracy and efficiency for small objects in complex aerial scenes, we propose a Configurable Global Context Reconstruction Hybrid Detector (GCRH) to enhance overall detection performance. The GCRH framework consists of three key components. First, the Efficient Re-parameterized Encoder (ERE) reduces the computational overhead of multi-head self-attention through re-parameterization while maintaining the integrity and independence of global–local feature interactions. Second, the Global-Aware Feature Pyramid Network (GAFPN) reconstructs and injects global contextual semantics, cascading selective feature fusion to distribute this semantic information across feature layers, thereby alleviating small-object feature degradation and cross-level semantic inconsistency. Finally, two configurable model variants are provided, allowing the control of high-resolution feature layers to balance detection accuracy and inference efficiency. Experiments on the VisDrone2019 and TinyPerson datasets demonstrate that GCRH achieves an effective trade-off between precision and efficiency, validating its applicability to small object detection in aerial imagery.
