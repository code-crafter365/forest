abstract = {Titanium matrix composites (TMCs) are promising next-generation lightweight, high-temperature structural materials owing to their high specific modulus and strength. To overcome the strength-ductility trade-off in TMCs, strategic design of reinforcements and grain structures is widely adopted. This study presents an innovative self-organization strategy involving polymer encapsulation of TC4 particles via wet mixing, followed by pressureless sintering and hot forging to fabricate (TiB + TiC + Ti3Si)/TC4 composites. This methodology enables in-situ formation of hybrid reinforcements within the matrix’s heterogeneous grain architecture. The results demonstrate that synergistic strengthening arises from load transfer by hybrid reinforcements coupled with substantial grain refinement, significantly enhancing the TC4 matrix strength. Incorporation of 2 wt% polymer elevates the strength of as-forged TMCs to 1367 MPa at room temperature, 721 MPa at 550 °C, and 589 MPa at 600 °C, representing a notable increase of 117.9 %, 176.7 %, and 190.0 % compared to that of the as-forged TC4.}
