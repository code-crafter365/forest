abstract = {This paper considers the puncture resistance of both Bombyx mori full cocoons (FC) and cocoon wall cutouts (CWC) subjected to the conditions of dynamic and static loading. The behaviour of both FC and CWC was characterised by assessment of deflection, needle penetration, and perforation. The apparent cocoon area was found to reduce linearly during puncture, reaching 8.3% of its initial value (p < 0.05), with 89% of the puncture sabot kinetic energy dissipated during penetration, demonstrating efficiency in energy absorption. Strain measurements reveal equatorial strain to be 0.16 while meridional strains are measured at 0.01. Auxetic behaviour is noted to occur along the meridional axis of full cocoons with a Poisson’s ratio recorded at -0.004. Comparing this to the equatorial Poisson’s ratio of 0.11 in full cocoons, highlights anisotropy of the cocoons. The uniform geometry of the needle radially distributes load. Although puncture strengths do not differ statistically, static tests reveal distinct force–displacement behaviours, with FC materials exhibiting ductile toughening prior to failure, and CWC materials linearly strain stiffening prior to brittle rupture. Failure initiates via interlaminar shear from sericin bond cracking, which progresses due to fibre displacement and stretching, culminating in rupture propagation while opposing compressive forces induce frictional and tensile fibre failure. These findings elucidate the cocoon’s adaptive defence strategies, offering potential insights for bioinspired puncture-resistant materials.}
