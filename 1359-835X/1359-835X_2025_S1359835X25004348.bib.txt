abstract = {In order to overcome the issues of low tear resistance and non-recyclability associated with conventional carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPs), the polymer binder required careful design. In this work, dynamic woven cross-linkers and multiple hydrogen bonds were introduced into polyurethane elastomers to obtain a series of high-toughness and recyclable polyurethane networks (WPINn). The toughness of WPIN0.5 elastomers has been determined to be as high as 314.2 MJ m−3, which exceeds that of many spider silks in nature. Simulation results confirmed the high energy dissipation of WPIN0.5 elastomers and provided insights into the toughening of elastomers. Furthermore, the WPIN0.5 samples exhibited exceptional solvent and thermal stability, as well as remarkable crack resistance with an energy of rupture reaching 223.1 kJ m−2. The recyclable and tear-resistant WPIN0.5-CF was prepared by complexing WPIN0.5 with carbon fiber (CF). The WPIN0.5-CF composites achieved strengths up to 442 MPa and tear resistance up to 1450 kJ m−2, which is 22 times higher than that of epoxy-CF composites. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of WPIN0.5, solvent-assisted WPIN0.5-CF was easily recycled to obtain WPIN0.5 and lossless CF. This strategy provided a new approach to producing tear-resistant and recyclable carbon fiber composites.}
