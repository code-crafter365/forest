abstract = {Slow fashion, as a strategic alternative aimed at mitigating resource waste and environmental degradation in fast fashion, necessitates the development of robust and durable fibers. Collagen-based fibers have emerged as a promising option due to their moisture properties, biodegradability, and biocompatibility for durable textiles. However, these fibers encounter significant challenges in terms of mechanical strength, durability, and viability for sustainable production. In this study, robust and durable collagen-based fibers were designed using a dual cross-linking strategy and continuously prepared in situ via a low-temperature aqueous coagulation device. During wet spinning, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) act as the continuant and cross-linker, respectively. AlCl3 effectively chelates the carboxyl groups on the collagen molecular chains and the reactive hydroxyl groups on the PVA chains, forming a stable coordination-hydrogen bond dual cross-linking network. Optimization of the spinning parameters resulted in fibers exhibiting superior mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 339 MPa, Young’s modulus of 12.9 GPa, and toughness of 93 MJ/m3. Additionally, these fibers demonstrate a 10.8 % moisture regain and a dyeing grade of 4, highlighting their enhanced durability and breathability. This research provides robust solutions for enduring fibers and sustainable manufacturing processes in the slow fashion sector, facilitating new opportunities for the sustainable utilization of collagen waste.}
