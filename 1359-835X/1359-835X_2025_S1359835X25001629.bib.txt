abstract = {Titanium matrix composites with homogeneous microstructures often exhibit inferior mechanical properties, thus severely restricting their applications for engineering-structural parts. Inspired by nature’s fine microstructures, we have in-situ constructed a novel two-scale structured (TiBw + Ti2Cu)/Ti6Al4V composites for significantly improve the mechanical properties of the Ti matrix, i.e., with the first-scale network reinforced by micro-TiBw and the second-scale network reinforced by nano-Ti2Cu. Average sizes of α-Ti were significantly refined with adding 2.53 vol% TiBw, and in-situ formed TiBw was favorable for formation of equiaxed α-Ti. At 293 K, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of (2.53 vol% TiBw + 3.02 vol% Ti2Cu)/Ti6Al4V composites were 1160 MPa and 1272 MPa, respectively, which were 47.2 % and 41.0 % higher than that of Ti6Al4V. Moreover, their maximum strength (514 MPa) is 27.4 % higher than that of Ti6Al4V alloy at 873 K. The remarkable increase in strength for the composites is attributed to fine-grain strengthening and precipitation-strengthening from Ti2Cu nanoparticles, and high temperature strength is due to the pinning effect of TiBw in the softened matrix and hinderance of flow in the matrix.}
