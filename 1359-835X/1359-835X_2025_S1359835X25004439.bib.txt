abstract = {Smart dry adhesives inspired by biological systems have shown great promise in robotics and handling applications but often face challenges in achieving both adaptability and strong adhesion, as well as rapid and controllable adhesion switching. Here, we present a magnetically triggered core–shell structured dry adhesive that enables ultrafast and reversible adhesion switching on both flat and curved surfaces. The adhesive consists of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) shell encapsulating a Magnetorheological Gel (MRG) core, whose modulus can be tuned from 5 kPa to 3000 kPa under an external magnetic field of 165 mT. This stiffness modulation induces a transition from a soft-core–stiff-shell to a stiff-core–soft-shell configuration, effectively reducing interfacial stress concentration and enhancing adhesion on flat surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate a 3.5-fold increase in adhesion force on flat silicon wafers (from 0.6 N to 2.1 N at 0.5 N preload) due to stress redistribution. On curved surfaces, the shape-locking effect further amplifies adhesion, achieving a 12-fold enhancement compared to the non-magnetized state. The adhesion switching response occurs within 1 s, enabling precise and rapid control. Finite element simulations further validate that the core–shell design optimizes stress distribution at the contact interface, preventing premature detachment. This bioinspired, magnetically responsive adhesive offers a scalable and energy-efficient solution for robotic gripping, wall-climbing systems, and precision assembly, where adaptive and high-speed adhesion control is required.}
