abstract = {Carbonous nanofillers have been extensively studied as effective interlaminar toughening materials for fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRP). However, their engineering applications are hindered by economic constraints and manufacturing complexities. This study introduces a facile and cost-effective laser-induced graphene (LIG) approach to enhance the interlayer performance of FRP, systematically comparing the toughening effects between the drawdown process and the transfer process with controlled coating density. Experimental results demonstrate that LIG exhibits superior uniform dispersion without pretreatment. Its higher zeta potential is conducive to interlayer penetration, while the intrinsic three-dimensional crosslinked graphene network changes crack propagation and failure modes, inducing crack deflection within layers, crack bifurcation in adjacent layers, and extensive fiber bridging. This makes LIG exhibit a toughening effect far superior to that of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Under identical processing conditions, LIG enhances mode I fracture toughness by up to 84.2%, while the transfer method with equivalent coating density achieves a 55.4% improvement. Both substantially exceed the CNTs-enhanced group (36.0%). This work establishes LIG as an economical and simple interlaminar toughening strategy with promising potential to replace CNTs in composite engineering applications.}
