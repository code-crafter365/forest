abstract = {The processing parameters during pyrolysis of carbon–carbon composites (CCCs) directly influence reaction kinetics and thus determine the end-part properties. This underscores the need for process optimization, particularly for complex temperature cycles. However, existing approaches for pyrolysis optimization are time-consuming and resource-intensive and often neglect the effects of complex temperature cycles. We present a machine learning-based framework to accelerate the characterization and optimization of pyrolysis in CCCs. Using targeted thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests, this approach efficiently optimizes pyrolysis parameters of a material. Additionally, transfer learning enables rapid adaptation to new material systems. Demonstrated on two phenolic-based materials, the machine learning model accurately predicts pyrolysis under complex cycles, using only eight TGA tests and achieving prediction errors under 3%. By coupling finite element (FE) analysis with machine-learning-based kinetics models, we also investigate thickness effects on pyrolysis.}
