abstract = {A continuous three-dimensional CF network was constructed to fabricate biconnected CF/Cu composites. The effects of two-step electrodeposition and CF volume fraction on the thermal and mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. The results indicate that the two-step electrodeposition effectively fills the contact pores between CFs, reducing the porosity of the composites by 50 % compared to one-step electrodeposition. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the composites prepared by two-step electrodeposition is enhanced by about 20 W m−1 K−1 relative to one-step electrodeposition, accompanied by a 25 % increase in bending strength. By controlling electrodeposition time, varying CF content on Cu foam can be obtained, enabling production of CF/Cu composites with different CF volume fractions. The 50 vol% CF/Cu composite exhibits excellent thermal conductivity, appropriate coefficient of thermal expansion, and outstanding bending strength.}
