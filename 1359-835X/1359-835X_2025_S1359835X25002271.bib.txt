abstract = {The microstructures of biological tissues can effectively guide the design of composite honeycomb sandwich structures. In this study, a cedarwood-inspired honeycomb core was proposed. In-plane compression tests were conducted on honeycomb cores and sandwich specimens to analyze the deformation and failure mechanisms of the cedarwood-inspired core and to examine their effects on the mechanical properties and failure modes of the sandwich structures. The cedarwood-inspired microstructure altered the load-transfer mechanism within the core, converting concentrated loads into distributed loads and restricting the expansion of unit cell deformations in the core. Experimental results indicated that the deformation and failure modes of the cores and sandwich specimens were modified, and the mechanical properties were significantly improved using the proposed cedarwood-inspired honeycomb cores. Specifically, the peak load of the cedarwood-inspired sandwich is 31.52% higher. Additionally, a theoretical prediction model was developed to determine Young’s modulus and peak load of the cedarwood-inspired core, offering valuable guidance for the design of future honeycomb cores.}
