abstract = {Controlling fiber orientation and porosity in short-fiber thermoplastic composites is important for enhancing mechanical, electrical and thermal properties in large-format additive manufacturing. This study employs a factorial design of experiments (DoE) to assess the effects of nozzle diameter (5.08 mm–10.16 mm), temperature (230–250 °C), and extruder screw speed (150–280 rpm) on flow rate, shear rate, porosity, fiber orientation, fiber length and tensile strength in 20 % carbon fiber-filled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. ANOVA results show that screw speed significantly impacts flow rate, while nozzle diameter and temperature have lesser effects. Shear rate increases with smaller nozzles and higher speeds. Porosity decreases from 5.58 % with a 10.16 mm nozzle to 3.11 % with a 5.08 mm nozzle at 150 rpm due to increased shear rates, which induce shear thinning, reducing viscosity and facilitating gas escape. Larger nozzles (10.16 mm) produce larger, more heterogeneous pores, while smaller nozzles (5.08 mm) yield smaller, uniform pores. Beads produced with the 5.08 mm nozzle exhibit longer fiber lengths due to reduced residence time, lower shear stress, and better alignment. Fiber orientation improves with smaller nozzles due to higher shear rates but decreases with higher screw speeds (280 rpm) due to shorter residence times. The highest fiber alignment (Axx ∼ 0.65) and low porosity (∼3%) were achieved with a 5.08 mm nozzle at 150 rpm, while equivalent additive manufacturing-compression molding samples exhibited better tensile strength (∼93 MPa) under these conditions. These findings emphasize the importance of optimizing processing parameters to enhance fiber alignment and reduce porosity for improved mechanical performance.}
