abstract = {In this work, tensile deformation and compressive deformation were conducted on the magnesium weld with addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and the microstructure evolution and deformation mechanisms were investigated. The results indicated that the addition of CNTs can promote grain refinement and transfer load during deformation, which was beneficial to improve the deformation ability of the weld. During deformation, the microstructure was refined and grain orientation tended to be consistent, and the texture intensity was gradually enhanced. The unfrequent {10 1¯ 3} twinning boundaries were observed in the original microstructure and gradually disappeared as deformation progressed. The primary deformation mechanisms involved {10 1¯ 2} extension twinning and basal slip. In the initial stage, the {10 1¯ 2} extension twinning was dominant, characterized by the massive formation of twins. In the later stage, basal slip became the predominant mechanism, and the {10 1¯ 2} twinning was subsequently inhibited. Besides, some {10 1¯ 1} twins were formed within the microstructure with the process of deformation.}
