abstract = {High-purity Ti3SiC2 MAX phase was introduced into the Amosic 3-303 SiC fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composite as a modified matrix by Reaction Melt Infiltration (RMI) at 1250 °C, realizing the generation of high-purity Ti3SiC2 phase without residual melt and by-products in the RMI matrix. This modification reduced the porosity of the SiCf/SiC-Ti3SiC2 composite from 10 to 20% typically found in SiCf/SiC composite prepared by Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI) to 6%, and the densification process cycle time by 70%. The flexural strength and thermal conductivity were enhanced by 12% and 58%, respectively. The microstructure and phase evolution of Ti3SiC2 in the SiCf/SiC composite matrix was systematically investigated, offering new insights into the ceramic matrix growth process during RMI. This work proposes a new method for utilizing the RMI process to prepare high-performance nuclear SiCf/SiC-based composites.}
