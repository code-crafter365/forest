abstract = {Copper matrix composites, known for their high strength, derive their desirable mechanical properties from strengthening effects of reinforcement. However, a single reinforcement provides a limitation of improvement in strength at the expense of plasticity. A strategy of synergistic improvement of strength and plasticity has been developed by incorporating two reinforcements with different aspect ratios. To this end, WC nanoparticles and SiC whiskers-reinforced copper matrix composites (WCp-SiCw/Cu) were prepared by intermittent pulsed electrodeposition and spark plasma sintering. These composites are designed with a unique core-shell structure, and thereby the agglomeration of reinforcements can be effectively avoided during sintering. As a result, the yield strength (323 MPa) of the WCp-SiCw/Cu is about double that of pure copper, while maintaining a high uniform elongation (15.3 %). The synergistic strengthening of the composites arises from the complementary advantages of the SiCw(s) and WCp(s). The results provide a promising route to preparing composites with comprehensive mechanical properties.}
