abstract = {This study investigated the mechanical properties and impact resistance of one-part engineered geopolymer composites (EGC), with a particular focus on the low-velocity impact behavior of one-part EGC under extreme temperature conditions. One-part EGC require only water for preparation, improving safety and convenience of construction. This study represents the first report on the impact mechanical performance of one-part EGC at −196 °C to 400 °C through low-velocity drop hammer impact experiments. The failure and damage mechanisms based on microstructure and fractal theory were analyzed, economic and environmental benefits of one-part EGC were discussed. The findings indicate that the ultimate tensile strain of one-part EGC can be up to 5.8 %, the compressive strength can be up to 48.1 MPa. In terms of impact performance, one-part EGC maintains high energy dissipation coefficient before penetration. In addition, the cost, embodied energy and embodied carbon reductions for one-part EGC were more than 10.1 %, 8.7 % and 23.1 %, respectively.}
