abstract = {In this study, the arrest behaviors of elastic wave metamaterials are analyzed in which the interconnected local resonators are considered. The influence of structural parameters on arrest performance is discussed to show good arrest properties. In order to support the theoretical calculation, both finite element simulation and fracture experiment are performed. Results show that additional energy barriers are generated in the higher subsonic range and the crack propagation resistance can be significantly improved by proper nonlocal interaction. Finally, based on the machine learning method, the energy release ratio G0/G of the elastic wave metamaterial is predicted. Comparing with the theoretical and predicted values, they are basically consistent in the stable range of energy release ratio.}
