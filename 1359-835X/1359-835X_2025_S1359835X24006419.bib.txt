abstract = {The growing demand for highly sensitive, flexible, and durable strain sensors has driven innovations in material design, particularly through the use of pre-cracked conductive networks. This review explores the significance of pre-cracked networks in enhancing strain sensing properties. We provide an overview of the mechanisms behind different types of cracks on sensing properties, along with a summary of commonly used fabrication techniques. The properties of strain sensors featuring various crack morphologies and hierarchical structures, such as channel, network and kirigami cracks, along with key crack parameters, such as density, depth and length, are reviewed. We also explore the trade-offs between sensitivity and stretchability, offering strategies to enhance both properties in pre-cracked strain sensors. Finally, practical applications of these sensors are highlighted, demonstrating their transformative potential across multiple fields, especially in wearable electronics, human–machine interfaces, healthcare monitoring, and vibration detection. This comprehensive review provides essential insights to advance strain sensing technology.}
