abstract = {To tackle the challenge of high shrinkage in sintered additively manufactured parts, a novel approach involving the modification of the printing composition through the incorporation of glass fibers was proposed. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, revealing a substantial improvement in the dimensional and geometrical accuracy of the fabricated parts. By incorporating 12 % short glass fibers into the composition, the shrinkage was significantly reduced, achieving an impressive 0.1 %.}
