abstract = {Anisotropy greatly limits the broad application of titanium matrix composites (TMCs). This study introduces cross-directionally rolling (CDR) as a method to optimize the microstructure and eliminate significant anisotropy in TMCs. The results show that uni-directionally rolling (UDR) induces a strong < 0001>//TD (transverse direction) matrix texture, with the TiB arranged along the RD (rolling direction). Quantitative analysis reveals that the anisotropy in conventional rolling processes (UDR) arises primarily from variations in Schmid factors along different tensile directions, which are caused by the < 0001>//TD texture. In contrast, the CDR process effectively weakens the matrix texture. The prior β phase reconstruction demonstrates that CDR weakens β texture, thereby reducing the < 0001>//TD texture of α phase. In addition, TiB reinforcement effectively weakens the adjacent matrix texture by inducing over four α variant selection during β → α phase transformation, and randomly oriented TiB under CDR is more effective in weakening the surrounding matrix texture. Importantly, the CDRed TMCs sheet exhibited excellent isotropy in tensile properties at various temperatures, indicating that CDR process is a feasible approach to overcoming significant anisotropy in TMCs.}
