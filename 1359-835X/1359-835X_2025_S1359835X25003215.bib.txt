abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has attracted interest from researchers in various engineering fields, including materials science and engineering. AI has enabled materials researchers to explore vast materials design spaces, which were previously inaccessible due to the inherent limitations of conventional techniques (viz., experiments and physics-based computational models). This is particularly true for the design of nanocomposites because of the many degrees of freedom associated with both material composition and manufacturing parameters. The primary motivation of this review is to report how AI techniques are being used in nanocomposite materials design, with special attention given to the manufacturing and property prediction of nanocomposites using AI techniques.}
