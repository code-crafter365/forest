abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, electronic devices have been widely used, and the resulting severe electromagnetic interference and radiation have caused serious impacts on people’s physical health and environmental safety. In order to solve these problems, the researches of electromagnetic shielding materials have flourished. This review discusses recent advances in polymer-based electromagnetic interference shielding composites, with a focus on structural designs (e.g., porous, layered architectures), functional fillers (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene), and polymer matrices (e.g., epoxy resins, polyurethanes). Representative processing techniques such as solution blending, melt blending, and 3D printing are also examined. A closed-loop research framework of “performance requirements – mechanism of action – material design – performance validation” is finally proposed to guide material selection and optimize multi-scale design. The review is expected to highlight future application prospects and to provide an innovative methodology for developing next-generation high-performance shielding composite materials.}
