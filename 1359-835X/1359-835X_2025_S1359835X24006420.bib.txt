abstract = {Out-of-plane wrinkles in laminated composites reduce the structural integrity. This study presents an algorithm to characterize wrinkle height and intensity of each lamina within a plain weave laminated composite, utilizing full waveform ultrasonic scan data. This algorithm enables the extraction of individual laminae in three dimensions. An immersion tank ultrasound testing system is employed for scanning coupled with a 7.5 MHz spherically focused transducer. Surface construction from the waveform entails a spatial Gaussian averaging followed by a tracking of voltage peaks in time of individual A-scans, from which we extract individual lamina interfaces. Four samples are presented with various wrinkle amplitudes encompassing a wide range of industrially relevant scenarios. The comparison of the ultrasonically characterized wrinkle heights with microscopic images of sectioned samples demonstrates consistency between the two methods, with a maximum deviation of 0.06 mm wrinkle amplitude across all samples considered in this study.}
