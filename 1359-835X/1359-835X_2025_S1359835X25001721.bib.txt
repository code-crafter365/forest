abstract = {From the perspective of weakening the inherent preparation defects of the SiO2f/SiO2 composite, a novel hybrid machining process combining ice densification pretreatment with rotary ultrasonic face grinding (IDP-RUFG) was firstly proposed in this study to reduce the contradiction between grinding surface quality and grinding efficiency. The improvement mechanism of IDP-RUFG process on the machinability of SiO2f/SiO2 composite was analyzed from material strengthening and grinding mechanics. The grinding experiments were carried out to confirm the surface integrity improvement in the IDP-RUFG process. By comparing with the conventional RUFG surface, the maximum peak height Sp on the IDP-RUFG surface was reduced by 16.6 %∼31.4 % with the 9.1 %∼27.9 % reduction in the debonding fiber damage ratio β. The subsurface damage patterns both in IDP-RUFG process and RUFG process were characterized by fiber–matrix interface debonding, subsurface cracks, and matrix fracture. However, the subsurface damage depth during the IDP-RUFG process could be reduced by more than 40 %.}
