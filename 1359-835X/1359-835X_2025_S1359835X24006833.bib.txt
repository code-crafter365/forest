abstract = {Metallic and dielectric metamaterials (MMs)/ metastructures possess exceptional advantages in enhancing electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption, yet they present inherent limitations, and obtaining highly efficient absorbers with a lower filling ratio and larger absorption bandwidth poses a challenge. In this study, by multi utilizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in MMs to excite the synergistic resonator-dielectric effect, an averaged 99 % absorption in 2–18 GHz is achieved. Using a layered cementitious metastructure as a case study, CNT paste is coated to the metastructure as a resonator, and CNTs are dispersed in cementitious dielectric as an absorbing agent. A model is proposed to reveal how the multi-function of CNTs manifest in the absorption performance, and the synergistic resonator-dielectric effects are thoroughly analyzed. Experimental results show that broadband near-perfect absorption can be achieved with only 0.95 wt% CNT content: the metastructure exhibits −21.3 dB average reflectivity (>99 % absorption), 9.6 GHz bandwidth for −20 dB (99 % absorption) and 2.5 GHz bandwidth for −30 dB (99.9 % absorption) in 2–18 GHz. This investigation reveals new synergistic mechanisms between the resonator and the dielectric, advancing the fundamental understanding of MMs, offering potential applications in various fields including communication systems, stealth technology and energy harvesting.}
