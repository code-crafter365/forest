abstract = {This study proposes a facile and cost-effective strategy to improve the processing flowability and mechanical properties of highly filled (HF) polymer composites while retaining their flame retardancy. Ionic liquids (IL), specifically 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium phosphate ([AMIM]PA), were synthesized and incorporated into HF magnesium hydroxide (MH)/linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) (60/40 by weight) composites. The MH/LLDPE composite containing 5 wt% of 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazole phosphate ([HDMIM]PA) exhibited significant improvements in processing characteristics, demonstrating a 50.7% reduction in equilibrium torque values, a maximum 13 times enhancement in melt flow index, and a 133% increase in impact strength. Morphological and rheological analyses demonstrated that [HDMIM]PA effectively promoted interfacial lubrication and compatibility between MH particles and LLDPE matrix, and consequently enhanced the overall properties. The flame retardancy assessments revealed that [AMIM]PA functioned as an intumescent flame retardant to make the material safer. This study thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of IL in enhancing the performance of HF polymer composites, offering a promising strategy for the development of advanced composites.}
