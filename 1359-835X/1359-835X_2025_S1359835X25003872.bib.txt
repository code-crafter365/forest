abstract = {Improving the mobility of 2D fillers in organic coatings is crucial in addressing anticorrosion and self-healing efficiency trade-off, while most previously proposed strategies focusing on polymer interfacial modification restrict enhancement in self-healing. Here, inspired by dragonfly wings, a robust photothermal-triggered intelligent self-healing coating is fabricated, which possess forming a 3D adaptive interpenetrating network structure and possessing the excellent anti-corrosion property. Through bionic design strategy of the soft membranes in polyfluoroacrylate (PTHBU) and rigid veins in polypyrrole-based nanotubes functionalized graphite nitrogen carbide (CPI), has been successfully constructed on the reinforcing steel substrate. Photothermal conversion triggered by CPI heterojunctions can effectively promote polymer chain movement and molecular rearrangement through heat transfer from 3D skeletons, leading to the enhanced self-healing efficiency (92.9 %). Additionally, the designed PTHBU/CPI coating maintains the superior corrosion resistance (icorr = 6.15 × 10-11 A·cm-2, and Rct = 7.38 × 109 ohm∙cm2) by coupling of the labyrinth effect of the nanoscale CN and the passivation-inhibition effect of the micro-scale PNT-IL. The bionic heterojunction enhancement strategy underscores the great potential as a feasible candidate material for advanced self-healing and long-term anticorrosion protection applied in harsh working conditions such as marine engineering and energy equipment.}
