abstract = {Automated fiber placement (AFP) technology enhances the structural efficiency in composite manufacturing through advanced steering control. However, its broader adoption is limited by steering-induced defects, particularly the out-of-plane buckling (wrinkling) of prepreg tows. Prepreg tack, a viscoelastic and process-dependent interfacial property, governs wrinkle initiation. This study develops a theoretical model to capture the coupled time–process effects driving wrinkle formation, providing a basis for defect suppression. Sensitivity analysis identifies normal tack as the dominant factor. Analytical solutions for the stress distribution coefficient and evolving minimum steering radius are derived. The model parameters are obtained experimentally. Model validation against steering experiments demonstrates strong agreement, with a maximum deviation of only 6.7% in the steady-state (equilibrium) minimum steering radius. The results underscore the potential of process optimization in enhancing tack performance and suppressing wrinkles. Based on these findings, a time–process-informed wrinkle control framework is proposed to support AFP design optimization, offering a practical approach to improve the quality and reliability of steering deposition.}
