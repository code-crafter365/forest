abstract = {This study prepared a multifunctional polymer quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) silicone coating by free radical polymerization of double bond flame retardant monomer, hydrophobic monomer, and antibacterial monomer. Then, sulfide copper (CuS) was in situ grown on the surface of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF), and QAS silicone coating was encapsulated at the outer surface. Due to the outstanding light absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency of CuS and polydopamine (PDA), photothermal sterilization property of the multifunctional FPUF was further improved. The multifunctional FPUF surface also showed significant antibacterial activity, achieving 100 % and 98 % anti-bactericidal rate for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In addition, the peak heat release rate and total heat release were reduced by 84.3 % and 54.7 % for multifunctional FPUF. Meanwhile, due to the conductivity of CuS nanoparticles, the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of FPUF@P@CuS@QAS reached 44.1 dB. Thanks to encapsulation of QAS silicone coating, the mechanical stability and hydrophobicity of FPUF@P@CuS@QAS were improved. Therefore, this study provides a promising approach to the mulrifunctional FPUF, which can be used for the clean production of modern medical electronic products and health EMI shielding materials.}
