abstract = {This study reports the findings from a round robin test exercise investigating ASTM D8336, a method for the measurement of tack of prepregs applicable to automated material placement technologies. Twelve participants tested two prepreg materials in a core study of three temperature and deposition/peel rate combinations, and five participants conducted an extended study based on a test matrix of four temperatures and four rates. In the core study, the repeatability coefficient of variation of obtained tack values ranged from 6.06 % to 15.08 %, while the reproducibility coefficient of variation ranged from 12.37 % to 32.37 %. The probable dominant causes for the observed variability are the limited accuracy of control and measurement of specimen temperature, of compaction force, and of humidity. Using time–temperature superposition, tack mastercurves were constructed from the extended study, identifying values of peak tack, the rate at peak tack and the width of the tack mastercurve, as well as the 95 % confidence and prediction bands. Across all materials and participants, 93.3 % of the repeats from the core study lay within the 95 % prediction bands, supporting the view that a mastercurve provides a greater degree of useful information at a comparable effort for data acquisition.}
