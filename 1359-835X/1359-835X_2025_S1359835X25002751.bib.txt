abstract = {To reduce cracking in Mar-M247 superalloy of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) manufacturing, this research explores the impact of the core–shell structure formed by adding different contents (0.5 and 1.0 wt%) of Y2O3 nanoparticles on the microstructure, crack behavior, and mechanical properties. Y2O3-doping facilitates the transition from columnar to equiaxed grains in the SLM process. The reaction of Y2O3 nanoparticles with oxide-forming elements in Mar-M247 alloy promotes the formation of Y2Hf2O7, which could act as the nucleation sites for MC carbides, forming a core–shell structure with Y2Hf2O7 as the core and MC carbides as the shell. The dispersed core–shell nanoparticles lead to the distribution of carbides both inside cells and at the cell boundaries, contribute to the reduction of dislocations pinned by MC carbides near the core–shell structure, and reduce the formation of dislocation walls, which helps to inhibit cracking. Moreover, both the γ′ phase and the core–shell structures can impede dislocation motion, alleviating local stress concentration at cell boundaries. The effect of Y2O3 nanoparticles on the metallurgical behavior of the molten pool and precipitation characteristics during the SLM process is analyzed to reveal the mechanism of the interactions between precipitates and dislocations as well as the crack inhibition.}
