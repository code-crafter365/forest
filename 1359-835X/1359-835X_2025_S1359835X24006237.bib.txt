abstract = {This work covers the characterisation of delamination growth in a carbon–glass interface, representative of the one in a wind turbine blade. A pure-moment-loaded Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test rig is used under quasi-static and fatigue loading. A new fatigue characterisation procedure is adopted by real-time controlling the prescribed energy release rate G. This procedure enables sweeping any desired G range at a user-defined rate independently of the compliance of the specimen. A finite element simulation using a cohesive zone model confirms the testing was performed at near pure mode II conditions. From the quasi-static tests, the onset and steady-state fracture toughnesses are characterised. Fibre bridging is observed, which is believed to explain the characterised R-curve effect. From the fatigue tests, Paris’ law is characterised in a wide Gmax range in each test. The characterisation of the quasi-static and fatigue fracture behaviour of the carbon-glass interface is thus successfully achieved.}
