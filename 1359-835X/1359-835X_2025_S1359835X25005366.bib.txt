abstract = {Marine equipment is confronted with multiple threats such as corrosion, low-temperature freezing and microbial fouling. Therefore, it is necessary to develop multi-functional protective coatings. In this study, the wear resistance, anti-fouling, photothermal, electromagnetic wave absorption, defrosting and deicing, and long-lasting anti-corrosion performance of modified polyurethane (PU) coating were improved by incorporating MoS2@CuS@ZIS ternary heterojunctions. The results show that the coating still maintains good corrosion resistance after being soaked for 90 days. The built-in electric field of the ternary heterostructure promotes the non-radiative recombination of electrons and holes, thereby enhancing the efficiency of photothermal conversion. In addition, with the dual dynamic covalent bonds of carbamate and oxime, the coating has a rapid self-healing performance. Defrosting and deicing under light can be completed within 130 s. In addition, the highly efficient catalytic performance of the S-type heterojunction, in synergy with Cu2+ ions, endows the coating with excellent antibacterial properties. The incorporation of filling materials has increased the wear resistance by 34 %. This work has important participation value for the research and development of new multifunctional PU coatings.}
