abstract = {Flexible pressure–temperature bifunctional sensor is an important component for realizing electronic skin, which plays an important role in human–computer interaction and health monitoring. However, complex environments require sensors with higher sensitivity, and the problem of mutual coupling between the signals of pressure–temperature bifunctional sensors remains to be solved. In this study, flexible pressure–temperature bifunctional sensors (FPTB-sensors) were proposed, which were based on ionic capacitors and temperature-sensitive resistors. Electrostatic spinning films with microcone structures were obtained by template-assisted electrostatic spinning and impregnation process, which enabled the FPTB-sensors to obtain high pressure sensitivities of 340. 02 kPa−1 (0–110 kPa) and 34.4 kPa−1 (110–300 kPa). By doping the thermoplastic polyurethanes/carbon nanotube material with ionic liquid, a temperature sensitivity of 0.0297 ℃−1 was obtained with a detection range of up to 80 ℃. In addition, the pressure signal was self-decoupled from the temperature signal due to the different sensing mechanisms for pressure or temperature. Finally, the FPTB-sensors were applied to a robotic electronic skin to enable the detection of different objects by grasping.}
