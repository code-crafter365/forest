abstract = {This study introduces a generic failure framework (GFF) for progressive damage analysis of fiber-reinforced composite laminates. The GFF provides a comprehensive, user-oriented method to evaluate failure mechanisms, including tensile, compressive, and impact damage, across diverse configurations, laminate layups, and loading conditions. It examines the influence of key design parameters — such as material properties, stacking sequences, and ply thicknesses — on failure progression and mechanical performance. Integrated into commercial finite element software, the GFF leverages built-in computational capabilities and employs an automated, script-driven parameterization procedure. This approach simplifies numerical analysis and facilitates structural optimization by accounting for the intrinsic features of composite laminates. Utilizing the cohesive zone model and a partition-tie scheme, the GFF captures matrix cracking, inter-laminar delamination, and their strong interactions with high fidelity. The performance of the numerical model is validated through representative case studies on open-hole tension, open-hole compression, and low-velocity impact tests, demonstrating satisfactory agreement with experimental data and confirming its accuracy and applicability.}
