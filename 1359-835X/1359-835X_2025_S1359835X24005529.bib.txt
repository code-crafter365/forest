abstract = {In this work, we developed a novel hard-magnetic photosensitive suspension with high solid loadings of 50 wt% for digital light processing 3D printing. The suspension combining photosensitive resin and reactive diluent can retain stability for 6 h. The printed materials from the suspension achieve a low modulus of below 900 kPa and high remanence of 83.7 kA/m. The suspension’s cure behavior was studied in detail to obtain the optimal printing parameters. The printing error of the small structures with feature size of about 1000 μm is kept below 20 %. Moreover, we proposed an efficient magnetization programming strategy for hard-magnetic soft actuators with desirable shapes based on the rod model considering the non-magnetic load. The accuracy and reliability of the strategy are verified by the experiment results. Finally, we designed and fabricated a “flower” using our method, achieving its closing action in accordance with the prescribed shape.}
