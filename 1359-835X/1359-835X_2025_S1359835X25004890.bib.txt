abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques allow the manufacturing of complex geometries with minimal material waste as compared to conventional counterparts. Recent advancements in material extrusion AM techniques facilitate the 3D printing of continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites in a thermoplastic matrix. This helps in significantly improving the mechanical performance of the resulting composites. Despite these developments, the hydrothermal aging behavior of 3D-printed continuous fiber-reinforced composites remains insufficiently explored, particularly in the context of long-term durability. This study investigates the effects of hydrothermal aging on the in-plane mechanical properties of continuous basalt fiber (CBF)-reinforced thermoplastic composites. Three thermoplastic matrices, including polylactic acid (PLA), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), were employed to evaluate the moisture uptake effect on the composites. The moisture absorption and diffusion behavior were evaluated and validated using Fick’s model. Tensile and flexural tests were conducted on both unaged and aged specimens, and failure mechanisms were analysed. Results indicated that unaged CBF/PLA composites showed the highest mechanical performance. However, these composites degraded as the aging progressed. Additionally, CBF/PETG composites retained better mechanical integrity after moisture exposure. Microstructural failure modes were examined using scanning electron microscopy at multiple magnifications.}
