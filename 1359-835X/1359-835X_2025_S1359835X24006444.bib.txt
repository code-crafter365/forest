abstract = {Voids are common manufacturing defects in composites, promoting damage and affecting failure responses. The present work employs a multi-scale modelling approach to investigate void effects on the Short Beam Shear (SBS) strength of cross-ply laminates. Meso-scale Representative Volume Element (RVE) models containing various void morphologies (content, shape, size and location) are built in Abaqus/Explicit. Voids are modelled explicitly, and the morphologies are chosen based on available experimental data. Damage models representing shear non-linearity, cohesive layer delamination and matrix cracking are introduced in the models. The RVE responses under shear loading are then homogenised, producing equivalent material properties for macro-scale SBS models. To this end, a user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT) is developed. This employs a trilinear material constitutive law to represent the progressive damage behaviour of laminates containing voids at the macro-scale. The effects of different void morphologies on the SBS strength are then investigated, showing good correlation with experimental data.}
