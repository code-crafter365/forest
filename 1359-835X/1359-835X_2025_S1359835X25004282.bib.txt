abstract = {Self-limit heaters based on carbon/polymeric nanocomposites with positive temperature coefficient of resistance (PTC) are expected to improve the stability of satellite thermal control systems. In this study, a new series of silicone rubber based ternary nanocomposites filled with the yttrium tungstate (YWO) with negative thermal expansion and graphene nanosheets (GNs) were successfully fabricated. The ternary nanocomposite shown improved PTC and achieved a maximum resistance change rate of 945.92 %. The size effect of YWO and in-situ Micro-CT observations were first time used to explain the PTC enhancement mechanism. The enhancement of PTC in ternary nanocomposites primarily relied on the promotion of local strain of graphene nanosheets by the thermal shrinkage of micro-sized YWO particles. In addition, the thermal stability of the nanocomposites was used to explain the partial elimination of the negative resistance temperature coefficient. The ternary nanocomposites with strong PTC effect have the resistance to voltage overload. The temperature fluctuation of nanocomposite heater was limited at 3.65 ± 1.05 °C. This work mainly highlights a kind of novel enhancement of increasing the nanocomposite PTC effect which is based on thermal motion. And it offers new insights into the design of advanced self-limited heating nanocomposites.}
