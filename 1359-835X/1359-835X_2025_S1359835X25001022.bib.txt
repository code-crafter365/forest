abstract = {The study demonstrates the development of a novel and sustainable sizing agent to improve the mechanical properties and compatibility of E-glass fibers (EGF) in cement composites. The sizing agent comprises chitosan (a biopolymer), graphene oxide and a calcium precursor. The graphene oxide and calcium ions help reinforce and crosslink chitosan fibers, enhancing the composite’s mechanical strength and bonding with the cement matrix. The tensile strength and the fracture strain of modified EGFs increased by 1.47 and 1.52 times, respectively. Due to the high deformation capability of the composite, the study revealed that the coating remains intact until the glass fiber fractures. Digital image correlation measurements on GFRC specimens confirm a strong bond between the coating and concrete matrix. The XPS and ATR-IR spectroscopy analyses confirm the interaction between surface-modified EGFs and cement matrix. The nanocomposite offers a sustainable alternative to conventional sizing employed in EGFs for GFRC applications.}
