abstract = {Silicone aerogel is one of the most noteworthy lightweight materials for thermal insulation, but it still faces the challenges of flammability and complicated preparation process. In this work, a novel multifunctional silicone/MXene composite aerogel (MTSAP) was prepared via ambient-pressure drying and dip-coating with TA modified MXene dispersion and polydimethylsiloxane. MTSAP exhibited light weight and excellent mechanical resilience. More importantly, it showed sensitive fire-warning capability and splendid flame retardancy. Thanks to the unique thermoelectric response characteristic of MXene, the Seebeck coefficient of MTSAP reached 6.4 μV·K-1 with good linear fitting. It triggered the early fire warning system within 0.8 s upon being burned. The limiting oxygen index of MTSAP exceeded 28.0 %. Additionally, it exhibited a rapid self-extinguish behavior after being removed from fire, its heat release rate and total heat release considerably decreased. Besides, MTSAP showed durable piezoresistive sensing, thermal insulation and superhydrophobicity. This work provides novel perspectives for the preparation and application of high fire-safety multifunctional silicone composite aerogels.}
