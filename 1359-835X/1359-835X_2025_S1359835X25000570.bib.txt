abstract = {Continuous composites offer substantial benefits to the composite industry, providing exceptional part strength and durability, but manufacturing complex topology optimized architected parts remains a challenge due to limited design flexibility and difficulty in achieving adaptable fiber orientation. This study presents an innovative approach, Additive Fiber Tethering (AFT), to additively manufacture topology optimized structures inspired by truss-based lattice. In this process, in situ impregnated towpregs are deposited across uniquely designed scaffold’s spatially distributed anchor points, enabling the formation of topology optimized architecture not possible with traditional composite manufacturing methods. For demonstration, an architected B-pillar is fabricated with spatially oriented continuous fibers for automotive applications. This approach aids the additive manufacturing and filament winding of topology optimized composite parts with continuous fibers, delivering key benefits such as enhanced weight reduction without compromising mechanical strength. This new manufacturing technology has great potential to advance composite applications in aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors.}
