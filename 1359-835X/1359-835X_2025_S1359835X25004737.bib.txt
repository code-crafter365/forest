abstract = {By processing both microstructure images and numerical material parameters, multimodal deep learning can predict the mechanical properties of composite materials with higher accuracy. However, current models require large datasets and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a deep learning paradigm consisting of modular convolutional and artificial neural networks (CNN & ANN). The CNN extracts science-informed parameters like filler fraction, geometry and orientation from microstructural images, which are combined with numerical material parameters and sent to the ANN for predicting composite properties. These predictions were compared against simulation and experimental results and found to deviate by < 7 %, with coefficients of determination ≥ 0.90. The present model is compatible with low-resolution images and requires only 1 % of the dataset employed by previous multimodal neural networks. It also overcomes the black-box nature of existing models, revealing, through studies on SiC-Al and carbon fiber composites, that cross-sectional geometries with higher interfacial area increase yield strength due to improved stress transfer between the reinforcement and matrix phases. However, they reduce ductility due to sharp edges acting as stress concentrators for crack nucleation. Their influence on ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was mixed, however, as UTS is highly influenced by both yield strength and ductility.}
