abstract = {With the development of the aviation industry, noise levels have become a key factor affecting aircraft comfort. Aircraft noise mainly consists of aerodynamic, structural vibration, and engine noise, each with unique intensity and frequency characteristics that differ from those in traditional building and rail transit. Thus, common noise-reduction materials like foams and fiber felts are no longer sufficient for future civil aircraft and propulsion systems. A major research direction in polymer-based composites focuses on designing material structures and understanding how microstructural features influence macroscopic noise-reduction performance. Moreover, applying advanced polymer composites to aircraft panels, engine nacelle liners, and other critical parts offers a promising way to reduce noise at the source, supporting overall noise control in next-generation aircraft, which is a central goal in current civil aviation research. This review first discusses the sources, hazards, and mechanisms of aviation noise, then introduces the classification and evaluation methods of s noise reduction polymer-based composites. It also summarizes recent global progress and trends in sound-insulation and sound-absorbing composites. Finally, it highlights advances in high-performance, multifunctional noise-reduction polymer-based composites and outlines future directions for aerospace acoustic materials.}
