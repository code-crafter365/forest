abstract = {A structural supercapacitor composite (SSC) is a multifunctional device that can perform load-bearing operations simultaneously while storing electrical energy. In this study, the impact of high loading graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) on carbon fibre (CF) electrodes on the electromechanical performance of SSC was studied. A stable GNP coating at the fibre/matrix interface with poly-tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder was obtained. GNP loading enhances the surface wettability of CF electrodes with the structural electrolyte, improving the electrochemical performance. The developed SSC demonstrated a specific capacitance of 123.5 mF g−1, with a 77 % improvement. In addition, after GNP loading, the tensile strength increased to 254.4 MPa, the modulus reached to 18.0 GPa, and the flexural strength improved to 48.9 MPa. In-situ mechano-electrochemical tests of SSCs showed over 60 % capacitance retention with no significant difference until mechanical failure occurred. These findings provide essential knowledge for further improvements of next-generation multifunctional energy storage composites.}
