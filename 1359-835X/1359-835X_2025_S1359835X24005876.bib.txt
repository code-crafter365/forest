abstract = {Structural batteries have sparked widespread research interest for their potential to increase energy storage, reduce weight, and save space in electrified transportation. Achieving long-lasting performance and high rate capability is crucial for practical applications. Our work successfully developed a self-supported LiDFOB-based structural electrolyte (LSPE) thin film with exceptional tensile strength of 3.65 MPa, film formability, electrochemical stability, and ionic conductivity of 2.2 × 10-4 S cm−1. This enables solid-state Li/LiFePO4 batteries to achieve superior specific capacity of 160 mAh/g and high rate capability up to 1C. Additionally, LSPE-based multifunctional energy storage composite laminates successfully powered a hologram with a starting current of ∼ 30 mA (corresponding to ∼ 1C), demonstrating its practical feasibility. Our study offers a promising method for producing high-performance structural electrolytes for structural batteries.}
