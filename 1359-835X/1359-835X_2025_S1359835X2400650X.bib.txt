abstract = {Epoxy resins are extensively used across various industries due to their exceptional adhesive strength, mechanical properties, and chemical resistance. However, their inherent brittleness, low crack resistance, and limited elongation and fracture toughness restrict their standalone applications. Although numerous toughening strategies have been explored, challenges such as increased viscosity, difficulties in achieving uniform dispersion, opacity, and limited improvement in elongation remain unresolved. To address these limitations, aliphatic diols with urethane linkages were synthesized with varying diamine chain lengths (230, 400) and used as additives in epoxy systems, resulting in the formation of nano-sized domains that promote phase separation. This phase-separated structure facilitated uniform stress distribution and enhanced energy absorption, leading to an elongation of 11.5 % at 50 % A-D230. A-D400 formed larger domains, exhibiting superior performance under high impact, with an Izod impact strength of 72 J/m. Furthermore, aliphatic-modified epoxy synthesized through the thermal reaction of aliphatic diol with epichlorohydrin, when used as a reactant, acted as a flexible segment in the epoxy matrix, enhancing stress absorption and toughness. This approach also demonstrated improved thermal stability and shear strength. The toughening strategies utilizing additives and reactants in epoxy can be tailored to meet the specific performance requirements, such as adhesive strength, impact resistance, durability, and fatigue life, making these epoxy systems highly applicable for automotive adhesive formulations.}
