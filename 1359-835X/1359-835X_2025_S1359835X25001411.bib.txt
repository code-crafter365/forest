abstract = {In order to obtain the high-performance milling technology of Multiphase fiber particle reinforced resin matrix composites (MFPRP), up\down milling experiments were carried out on different planes of MFPRP. Through data statistics, experimental observation, and mechanism analysis, the effects of cutting force, surface roughness and surface morphology on surface quality were qualitatively and quantitatively studied. The results show that up milling for the XOY plane produces smaller cutting forces and only produces aramid fiber burr damage on the machined surface at the scale of a few hundred micrometers; whereas the surface quality for the down milling for the XOZ plane is higher, with the smallest surface roughness obtained, and the machining of a smooth surface. Meanwhile, different milling strategies for up milling of XOY plane and down milling of XOZ plane are obtained based on genetic algorithm, which provides theoretical and experimental bases for milling of fiber reinforced composites.}
