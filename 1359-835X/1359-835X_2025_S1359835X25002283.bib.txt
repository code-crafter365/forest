abstract = {Current superhydrophobic coatings suffer from low thermal conductivity (TC), complex processes, and irreparability, limiting their effectiveness in condensation heat transfer for steam energy recovery, especially with low-grade steam. This study focuses on surface modification to enhance condensation heat transfer and develops superhydrophobic coatings with high TC and self-healing properties for practical applications. We investigated the synergistic effects, and the mechanisms of damage and self-healing processes. By optimizing the formula, we improved the hydrophobicity, TC, and mechanical strength. The “brick-and-mortar” coating was created by the self-assembly of SiO2 and graphene, the hybrid curing of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and the cross-linking with silane coupling agent. It achieved a water contact angle (CA) of 162.7 ± 2.1°, hardness (ISO 4H), adhesion (ISO Level 1 or ASTM 4B). It exhibited stable superhydrophobicity under mechanical and chemical damage, maintaining dropwise condensation for at least 90 days even after damage. The SiO2@PDMS structure endows the coating with self-healing properties under light/thermal treatment. Its |Z|0.1 Hz remained at 1.3 × 10^10 Ω cm2 after 7 days in the 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Applied to stainless steel, the coating increased heat conduction by 45.4 % and the heat transfer coefficient for low-grade heat by up to 142.6 %, with a 5:4 contribution from superhydrophobicity and high TC. The outstanding TC, low cost, and self-healing properties of this superhydrophobic coating give it broad application prospects in low-grade steam recovery.}
