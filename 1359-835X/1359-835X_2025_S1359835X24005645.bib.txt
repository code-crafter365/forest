abstract = {Highly flexible, ultrathin and mechanically robust aerogel films activated by functional nanofillers exhibit tremendous potentials for wide applications. However, it is difficult to design different functionalities in a single aerogel film, as different nanofillers often possess opposing properties. Herein, a LEGO®-inspired fabrication strategy to construct Kevlar-based aerogel film with arbitrarily designed functions is introduced by stacking functionalized aerogel film units as stacking LEGO® bricks. The aerogel film units are reliably connected by precursor dispersion-derived LEGO® embossed nodes, leading to superior mechanical strength. Moreover, owing to the flexibility of the LEGO®-inspired assembly method, targeted functions of the aerogel films can be achieved by designing and purposefully combining various stacks. As demonstrations, optimized joule heating, greatly enhanced electromagnetic wave shielding and excellent flame-retardant properties are realized with stacking of different aerogel film units. The unique fabrication strategy opens up opportunities for the design and fabrication of aerogel film with tunable and tailored properties for wide applications.}
