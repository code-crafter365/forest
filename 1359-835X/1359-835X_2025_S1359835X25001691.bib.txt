abstract = {The application of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composite (CFRP) fan blades is crucial for weight reduction in high bypass ratio turbofan aircraft engines. Automated fiber placement (AFP) has the greatest potential for automating the production of CFRP fan blades. To help achieve high manufacturing quality and stability of fan blades, this review summarizes the key areas of AFP forming fan blades and generates an overall understanding of the key scientific challenges. Based on these understandings, an integrated research and development method for AFP (IRDM-AFP) is proposed, integrating virtual and measured data-driven modeling methods for parameter optimization to assist the manufacturing of high shape accuracy and performance of fan blades. The feasibility and necessity of IRDM-AFP is demonstrated through a preliminary study of AFP forming experiment for fan blade in an element level. This review provides a promising method for subsequent research and applications on AFP forming of CFRP fan blades.}
