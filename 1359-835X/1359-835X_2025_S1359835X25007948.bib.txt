abstract = {Dry spots are the most concerned molding defects in Liquid Composite Molding (LCM). Their final size and position are affected by the evolution of entrapped air in the flow field, thus predicting this evolution via simulation is crucial. However, existing macroscale entrapped air prediction models cannot effectively predict both the migration and size evolution of entrapped air simultaneously when the injection pressure is reduced or the vent ports are opened. We developed a macroscale three-dimensional compressible two-phase flow model to predict the evolution of entrapped air and the subsequent formation of dry spots during the LCM filling process. Thereafter, sandwich-panel and flat-panel vacuum infusion experiments were conducted to verify the proposed model. Simulation results indicate that the proposed model can accurately predict evolution of entrapped air regions’ size and position in the experiments.}
