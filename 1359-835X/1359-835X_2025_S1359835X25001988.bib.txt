abstract = {Substantial progress has been achieved in the investigation of dispersive ceramic-reinforced aluminum composites, yet their broad deployment in challenging mechanical settings remain limited by the inherent malleability of aluminum. Here, a novel 3D-architectured metal/ceramic composite was fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM) and gas pressure infiltration. This innovative approach allows for unprecedented design flexibility, particularly in the reinforcement topological architecture, where the integration of a periodic Gyroid structure significantly enhances performance capabilities. The 3D-architectured metal/ceramic composite exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, boasting a remarkable compressive strength that is 4.6 times greater than that of the matrix. The presence of a ductile–brittle interface plays a dual role in ceramic integrity: it not only suppresses ceramic cracking but also impedes the progression of cracks, thereby altering the failure mode from catastrophic to localized and manageable. The bi-continuous structure enables the ductile metal to be supported by the rigid ceramic, thereby preventing excessive plastic deformation under high loads. Consequently, the load-bearing capacity of the 3D-architectured metal/ceramic composite doubles, while the residual strain during cyclic loading decreases by 50%. This innovative 3D-architectured metal/ceramic composite successfully breaks the traditional trade-off between stiffness and toughness in structural materials, offering a promising solution for high-impact resistance applications.}
