abstract = {This study proposes a methodology to investigate the rate dependency of Mode I fracture toughness in fracture delamination specimens under high-speed loading conditions. Through both analytical modelling and experimental testing, the influence of elastic vibrations on fracture mechanisms during crack initiation and propagation is explored. An updated analytical model for calculating dynamic fracture toughness during crack propagation, considering elastic vibrations and crack velocity, is proposed and validated using a numerical model from the literature. Experiments conducted on composite adhesive joints with a custom high-speed apparatus provide critical data on the fracture behavior of the specimen. Finally, the study examines the relationship between fracture toughness and strain rate under dynamic loading conditions, a correlation commonly incorporated into numerical models.}
