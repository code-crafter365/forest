abstract = {The study aims to develop novel polyetherimide (PEI) composite formulations by the incorporation of recycled carbon fibers (rCFs), thermal black (TB) particles, and the combination of rCF/TB hybrids. Thermoplastic composites were prepared by melt compounding of an amorphous PEI, rCFs, and TB particles. Four (4) formulations of composites were prepared, with a maximum loading of 20 wt% of rCF and a gradual replacement of rCF by TB. These formulations were used to manufacture standard specimens through injection molding (IM) and Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) after being extruded into filaments. The effect of rCF and TB contents on the mechanical performance, the thermal behaviour, and on the microstructure of injected and FFF printed specimens were evaluated and analyzed. Incorporating 20 wt% rCF increased the tensile modulus of IM specimens from 3.2 GPa to 6.2 GPa, while tensile strength improved from 74 MPa to 103 MPa. FFF printed composite specimens with 20 wt% of rCF presented a tensile modulus of 4.3 GPa and a tensile strength of 70 MPa, respectively. The heat deflection temperature (HDT) of the IM and FFF printed composite increased from 177 °C to 200 °C with the addition of 20 wt% of rCF, a common metric for assessing the maximum service temperature. X-ray micro-tomography was carried out to assess the composites’ porosity contents and, as well, the rCF average legth and orientations. X-ray micro-tomography results illustrated that the presence of rCF led to a maximum porosity formation of up to 17 % in the FFF printed specimens. As expected, the initial length of the raw rCF was reduced from 6 mm down to approximately 30 μm mainly due to the shear forces applied during the different steps of the manufacturing process, i.e., composites compounding, filament extrusion, and FFF printing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images obtained on fractured surfaces revealed that the incorporation of TB seemed to improve the fiber matrix adhesion when compared to composites containing only rCF. The obtained results allowed us to understand the thermal and mechanical performance of these novel composites and their potential for FFF 3D printing of parts for aircraft interior or ground transportation applications.}
