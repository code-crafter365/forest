abstract = {Lunar construction is challenged by harsh environments and limited resources. Inflatables, with their inherent adaptability, offer promising solutions. This study introduces rigidizable inflatable lunar habitats using silicone-coated aramid fabric (SC-AF) as restraint layer and shape memory polymer (SMP) for rigidization. SC-AF exhibits excellent mechanical stability, folding capability, and tear resistance. After one fold, stiffness dropped by 17 % with negligible strength loss. X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis revealed fiber deformation, misalignment, and coating micro-cracks, while fiber integrity remained almost intact. After 500 folds, stress dropped 19 % and stabilized after 10,000 cycles. Even after 50,000 folds, the material retained 29 % of its original strength without major fiber rupture, confirming Kevlar’s toughness. Practical applications involve fewer folds and less repetitive angles, allowing for a 20 % design safety margin. A theoretical dual-layer beam model evaluates equivalent stiffness based on material stiffness and thickness ratios, offering design limits and guidelines for rigidization and vibration control. For the SMP used, a thickness ratio of 0.02 or 1 is recommended, not exceeding 5. Rigidization capability should align with structural load-bearing requirements. This study integrates analytical, experimental, and numerical methods to advance high-strength restraint materials, examines folding-induced performance changes, and establishes design principles for SMP-based variable stiffness applications.}
