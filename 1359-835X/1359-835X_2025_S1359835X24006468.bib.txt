abstract = {Flexible piezoresistive pressure sensors (FPPSs) are integral to a diverse array of fields, including soft robots, human–machine interfaces, and health monitoring. Central to their functionality and widespread adoption is the use of polymer materials, which offer exceptional flexibility, easy conformal, durability, and cost-effectiveness, as well as ease of preparing various micro/nanostructures. The structural engineering of FPPSs, particularly by modifying the micro/nanostructure of the substrate to affect the active layer, significantly enhances critical performance metrics such as sensitivity, dynamic range, detection limit, and response times. This review methodically examines a variety of polymer-based FPPSs, showcasing both single and hierarchical micro/nanostructures with different strategy to highlight how structural engineering can boost sensor performances. Furthermore, representative applications of FPPSs are discussed to illustrate their practical utility. The paper concludes by synthesizing current challenges and providing a forward-looking perspective on the future development of micro/nanostructured FPPSs, emphasizing their potential to drive significant technological breakthroughs.}
