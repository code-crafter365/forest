abstract = {Shells are natural composites with outstanding mechanical properties, achieved through a combination of calcium carbonate flakes and organic layers arrangements. Here, inspired by the layered structure of shell pearl, we report a Cf/(PyC/SiC)n composites with high residual strength and good anti-ablation properties prepared via one-step chemical vapor infiltration method. The layered biomimetic structure increased the sliding resistance induced by the clamping stress to promote cracks deflection at multi-layer interface, where multiple crack initiation at a PyC weak layer followed by crack deflection in a SiC tough layer. The flexural strength of as-prepared Cf/(PyC/SiC)5 composite was significantly improved about 55.7 % in comparation to Cf/PyC/SiC composite. After ablation, the flexural strength of Cf/(PyC/SiC)5 composite degraded by only 11.2 %, while that of Cf/PyC/SiC composite reduced about 32.4 %. This work is expected to provide insights for the preparation of high-performance carbon-based composites, with promising applications as thermal protection materials in aerodynamic heating environments.}
