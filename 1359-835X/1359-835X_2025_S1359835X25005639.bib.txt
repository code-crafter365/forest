abstract = {An electrical field distorted by the complicated cable accessory structure and nonuniform temperature distribution is a significant threat to high voltage direct current (HVDC) cable. Silicone rubber (SR) based composites with nonlinear conductive properties via embedding semi-conductive and conductive fillers to construct hybrid filler networks can ameliorate these problems in cable accessories. Herein, a new strategy of incorporating graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3) nanoparticles through a self-assembly approach is proposed to prepare a novel uniform filler to fabricate the SR composites, which are supposed to exhibit superior nonlinear electrical conductivity and good thermal conductivity, together with relative high breakdown strength and mechanical properties. The nonlinear conductivity α of the 25GQDs@Al2O3/SR composite reached 2.38 at 70 °C, as well as the threshold field strength Eb of 3.67 kV/mm. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of 25GQDs@Al2O3/SR was 0.225 W m−1 K−1 at 23 °C, which increased by 11.23 % compared to that of 25Al2O3/SR. And the breakdown strength of 5GQDs@Al2O3/SR was 73.74 kV/mm at 50 °C, achieving an increase of 53.43 % compared to that of pure SR. This work has provided a fresh solution to better regulate the characteristics of nonlinear composite dielectrics of SR hybrid network.}
