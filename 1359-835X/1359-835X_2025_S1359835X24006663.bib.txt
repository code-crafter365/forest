abstract = {Fiber-based wearable electronics represent an advanced technology, enabling innovative applications in flexible, lightweight, and textile-integrated systems for continuous, non-invasive health monitoring. This research introduces a novel method for fabricating highly stretchable, conductive microfibers through a wet-spinning process that incorporates carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Ti3C2Tx MXene into a styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) fiber matrix. By employing the synergistic effects between the one-dimensional (1D) CNTs and two-dimensional (2D) MXene, our approach significantly improves both mechanical robustness and sensitivity to deformation in the composite conductive network, effectively overcoming the limitations typically encountered in single-filler fibers. The SEBS/CNTs-Ti3C2Tx composite fibers exhibit outstanding mechanical performance, with an elongation at break surpassing 1000 %, and are capable of enduring substantial strain without compromising electrical conductivity. These fibers maintain exceptional electromechanical stability and sensitivity across a wide range of strain conditions, ensuring reliable, real-time monitoring of human motion signals. Furthermore, a textile woven from these composite fibers shows impressive electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance, achieving an effectiveness of 45.1 dB within the 8.2–12.8 GHz frequency range. This bi-functionality emphasizes the substantial potential of the SEBS/CNTs-Ti3C2Tx composite fibers for both healthcare and smart textile industries.}
