abstract = {Excess exudate and bacterial infections easily cause inflammation, significantly impeding wound healing. While unidirectional moisture-conducting materials have been utilized to manage exudate, they frequently fail to regulate cellular behaviors critical for skin repair. This study developed a novel nanofibrous scaffold (Zn@PAN/Cu@TPU-Cur) designed for unidirectional extraction of exudate, integrating pharmaceutical and electrical functionalities through electrospinning a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofibers with copper (Cu) nanoparticles and curcumin (Cur), alongside polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers embedded with zinc (Zn) nanoparticles. The Zn@PAN/Cu@TPU-Cur establishes a stable asymmetric wetting gradient between the hydrophobic TPU and hydrophilic PAN, facilitating rapid unidirectional transport of wound exudate. During transport, Cu/Zn galvanic couples generated electrical stimulation (peak voltage 465 mV), making Zn@PAN/Cu@TPU-Cur an “electronic” scaffold. The combined effects of Cu/Zn stimulation and Cur enhanced the scaffold’s antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and mitigated M1 macrophage polarization. These findings suggest this advanced scaffold could provide an efficient and safe solution for managing exudative wounds.}
