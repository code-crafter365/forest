abstract = {In this study, the effects of platelet flow on the tensile properties of Discontinuous Fiber Composites (DFCs) are investigated. A “low” flow condition, where platelets are packed into a square mold, and a “high” flow condition, where platelets are forced to flow into a cavity, are studied. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans are performed to obtain the exact probability distribution of orientations in the coupons. These distributions are then used to generate the DFCs’ random mesostructures for finite element (FE) models. The models are validated against uniaxial tension experiments. The FE models can precisely predict the elastic modulus, strength, and failure locations seen in the experiments. The mesostructure generation allows for the creation of digital DFC coupons that mimic platelet flow conditions. Thus, a better understanding of failure mechanisms of complex DFC systems can be obtained.}
