abstract = {This study investigated the variability in mechanical behavior and notch sensitivity of nylon/glass fiber woven organosheets, offering vital insights for woven thermoplastic composite material design. Combining experimental analyses and advanced computational modeling through the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model, the study examines the tensile properties and failure mechanisms of the 2/2 twill woven organosheet. The CDM model accurately predicts unnotched tensile behavior, identifying key damage modes. Additionally, the study explores the hole size effect in open hole tension (OHT) configurations, utilizing both experimental and CDM results to calibrate the analytical modified point stress criterion (MPSC) model. The analytical notch sensitivity curves derived from both experimental and computational methods closely align, demonstrating the viability of virtual testing for OHT characterization. Furthermore, the research investigates the effect of local meso-structure of 2/2 twill weave on strength variability.}
