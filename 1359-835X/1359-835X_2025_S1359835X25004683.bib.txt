abstract = {Weld lines are often unavoidable defects in the injection molding of short fiber-reinforced thermoplastic (SFRT) components, compromising aesthetics and mechanical performance. This study introduces a novel approach, Gas-Assisted Push-Pull (GAPP) injection molding, to promote polymer flow across the weld surface via the injection of high-pressure nitrogen in specific locations of the mold. Testing on 20%, 30%, and 40% short glass fiber reinforced recycled polypropylene (PP) showed that the GAPP process significantly increased the mechanical performances of the samples, especially in higher fiber content materials. Compared to samples having a weld line, the GAPP process produced a 64% increase in strength and a 13% increase in stiffness in the 40% fiber-reinforced polypropylene samples. Process simulations on Autodesk Moldflow Insight (AMI) 2023 showed good agreement with experimental fiber orientation measurements obtained through X-ray computed tomography (CT).}
