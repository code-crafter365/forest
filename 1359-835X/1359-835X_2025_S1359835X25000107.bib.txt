abstract = {Hydrophobic modification is an innovative strategy to address the deterioration of composite caused by water absorption in marine environment. This study develops a novel hydrophobic coated composite, whose long-term tensile strength is 28.9 % higher than that of pristine composite after immersing in seawater for 90 days. The underlying deterioration mechanism of hydrophobic coated composite has been revealed via molecular dynamics simulation. Fluorinated Si-O-Si groups and C-F bonds promote the physical hydrogen bonding network and chemical covalent bond between fiber and hydrophobic coating, enhancing intermolecular interactions and bonding strength. Polyfluorinated modification weakens the interaction with seawater, improving the resistance of hydrophobic coated composite in marine environment. Bridging Na+ ions form topological structures in hydrophobic system, delaying the separation of fibers from the resin and protecting the integrity of composite in seawater. This work reveals the deterioration mechanism of hydrophobic coated composite, providing strategy support for inspiring durable composite in marine engineering.}
