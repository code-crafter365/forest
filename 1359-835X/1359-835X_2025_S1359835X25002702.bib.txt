abstract = {The comprehensive utilization of pultruded plant fiber reinforced composites (PFRCs) is limited by the sensitivity of twisting and hierarchical structures to processing parameters. Processing optimization and mechanical design of pultruded sisal fiber reinforced composites (SFRCs) were investigated. Firstly, a custom-designed pultrusion system was developed considering the twisting and hierarchical structural characteristics of plant fibers. Secondly, the processing parameters were optimized through experiments to enhance their mechanical properties. The relationships between the microstructure (twist angle), processing parameters (pulling speed and temperature) and mechanical properties (tensile, flexural and interlaminar properties) of pultruded SFRCs were clarified via ANOVA analysis. Finally, a modified theoretical model integrating variations in twist angle and processing parameters was proposed to predict the tensile modulus of pultruded SFRCs. The results demonstrated that the twist angle of sisal yarn decreased after formation due to tension. Accurate predictions on tensile modulus of pultruded SFRCs were achieved using the modified theoretical model.}
