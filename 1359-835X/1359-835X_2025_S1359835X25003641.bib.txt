abstract = {Composite materials with integrated electromagnetic (EM) shielding and absorption functionalities are essential for effectively mitigating electromagnetic interference (EMI). In this study, wood-based aerogels were synthesized using porous natural wood templates. The three-dimensional (3D) porous structure enables efficient multiple reflections and scattering of EM waves. To optimize impedance matching and enhance the synergistic EM loss mechanism, FeCo, Fe, and Co magnetic metal–organic complexes were in-situ loaded onto the aerogel skeleton through a solvothermal method. Subsequently, the magnetic metals (Fe, Co) loaded wood carbon aerogel (FeCo@WCA, Fe@WCA, Co@WCA) composites with exceptional EM shielding and absorption properties were successfully prepared by heat treatment. The EM shielding effectiveness of the three composite materials all exceed 60 dB, with the minimum reflection loss (RL) value reaching approximately −50 dB. Furthermore, these composites demonstrate excellent electro thermal conversion performance, superior thermal stability, and rapid temperature response. This study proposes a sustainable strategy for the preparation of lightweight and highly efficient wood-based carbon aerogel materials for EM shielding and absorption applications.}
