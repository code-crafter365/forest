abstract = {Inorganic tungsten trioxide (WO3) photochromic materials have attracted growing attention because of their superior photochemical stability, excellent reversibility and high contrast ratios. However, the weak mechanical properties and slow photoresponse speed hinder their development and practical application. Here, a high-performance and rapidly photoresponsive paper with a nanoarchitectonics of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-doped WO3 modified oxidized lignocellulosic (OLC) skeleton was fabricated by vacuum filtration self-assembly technique and in-situ growth process. The hydrogen bonds among OLC, PVP and WO3, together with coordination bonds between PVP and WO3, give the resulted OLC-based paper a high tensile strength (197.55 ± 5.94 MPa), superior to most OLC-based/WO3-modified composites. Furthermore, PVP as an electron donor can accelerate the electron–proton double injection of the PVP-doped WO3 system and greatly improve the photoresponse speed (10 min) of OLC-based paper. In addition, the paper pattern and reversibility test have proved its application possibility. This construction method provides an attractive strategy for sustainable development of photochromic materials in rewritable media, information storage and intelligent sensor.}
