abstract = {This study examined the effects of nozzle diameter and fibre pre-tension on the impregnation quality and mechanical performance of GRAM robotized wet filament-wound composites. The use of a larger nozzle improved fibre impregnation, reduced void content from 6 % to 2 %, and enhanced composite uniformity. Higher fibre pre-tension (10 N) flattened fibre tows, increasing packing density and resin distribution, which minimized voids and improved mechanical properties. In contrast, lower pre-tension (5 N) resulted in increased voids and weaker composites. Mechanical testing showed that samples produced with higher pre-tension and larger nozzles exhibited more consistent mechanical responses. Although the larger nozzle samples were ∼7 % stronger than those made with a smaller nozzle, the study highlighted the importance of optimizing fibre impregnation & compaction for achieving high-performance filament-wound composites.}
