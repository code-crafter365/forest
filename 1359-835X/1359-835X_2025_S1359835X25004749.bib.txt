abstract = {Fatigue behaviour of fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) in laboratory is typically evaluated under continuous loading. However, real-life loading scenarios of structures, e.g. bridges or wind turbine blades, often involve complex histories. These include fatigue loading interruptions, creep, combined creep-fatigue, or peak loads. While such variations may be negligible for elastic carbon and glass fibres, the viscoelastic nature of flax fibres makes them sensitive to complex loading patterns, potentially affecting the fatigue performance. Moreover, some flax preforms are made of twisted yarns, adding one more level of complexity to the hierarchical microstructure of flax FRP laminates. However, the effects of auxiliary loading sequences and the microstructure at the yarn/fibre levels, on the fatigue behaviour of flax FRPs remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper pioneers investigation of these effects, giving insights on how to exploit microstructural re-arrangements, preloading, and load interruptions to tailor fatigue response of flax FRPs in comparison to glass FRPs. The findings reveal that the yarn un-twisting significantly influences fatigue behaviour, leading to a doubling of strain accumulation, and dynamic stiffness increment, compared to flax FRPs with straight fibres. Additionally, the pre-creeping and fatigue interruptions were found to substantially impact fatigue life, particularly in laminates with yarn twist, leading to a 1.7-fold increase due to interruptions and a threefold increase following pre-creeping. The latter also yielding a near-elimination of strain accumulation. Therefore, pre-creeping is proposed as an effective strategy to reduce in-service strain accumulation and extend fatigue life in predominantly UD flax FRPs with twisted yarns.}
