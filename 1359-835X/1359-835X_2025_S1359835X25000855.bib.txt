abstract = {Constructing efficient and multifunctional integrated electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing materials is an effective strategy to address the complex electromagnetic environments. Herein, the ZIF-67@CNT with multidimensional heterogeneous structure were designed and embedded into the polyimide (PI) skeleton to obtain the Co@CNT carbon foams (Co@CNT/CF) by high-temperature annealing. The microstructure, electromagnetic parameters of Co@CNT/CF can be tailored by adjusting the size and the loading of ZIF-67@CNT. The Co@CNT/CF demonstrated a minimum reflection loss of −61.7 dB at 7.3 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth of up to 10.36 GHz at 5.8 mm, covering the entire X and Ku bands. The radar cross section (RCS) distribution indicated that Co@CNT/CF exhibited excellent RCS attenuation capability with the maximum value of 17.1 dB m2. Further exploration demonstrated that Co@CNT/CF displayed excellent mechanical properties, flame-retardant and thermal insulation performance, which provides a research strategy for the design of multifunctional EMW absorbing materials in extreme environments.}
