abstract = {Recent biomimetic strategies have revolutionized metal matrix composites (MMCs), leading to materials with multiscale architectured microstructures and exceptional properties. Nature-inspired structures outperform traditional random microstructures, offering opportunities for innovative lightweight materials. Taking inspiration from nacre’s layered structure, a powder assembly-based bottom-up approach called flake powder metallurgy (flake PM) has been introduced and has emerged as the prevailing model for developing a new generation of high-ductility, high-strength MMCs. This review systematically introduces and analyzes this strategy from technological and scientific perspectives. We demonstrate its broad applicability to various metallic matrices/reinforcements and its potential for designing intricate heterogeneous architectures. Additionally, underlying mechanisms, basic principles, and recent advances in flake PM are discussed. Our aim is to draw attention to this architectural design concept, propose new research directions for MMCs with multiscale architectures, and present notable research results.}
