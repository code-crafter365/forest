abstract = {Organic solid–liquid phase change materials (PCMs) offer exceptional heat absorption/release capacity but suffer from leakage risks and low thermal conductivity, hindering their practical implementation in electronics thermal management. In this study, we propose a facile strategy to fabricate form-stable PCMs with high thermal conductivity by constructing segregated boron nitride (BN) thermal conduction networks within a poly(styrene-b-ethylene-butylene-b-styrene) (SEBS)-supported paraffin wax (PW) matrix (SEBS/PW). Inspired by wet spinning technology, we developed solvent-exchange-driven SP (SEBS/PW) microparticles via solution-spray coagulation. Through dynamic co-suspension of SP microparticles with BN platelets followed by gel-state hot-pressing, we achieved a continuous BN segregation network. The resulting composite with a SEBS/PW mass ratio of 20/80 and 30 wt% (16.3 vol%) BN loading exhibits excellent shape stability, high enthalpy (129.8 J/g), and enhanced in-plane thermal conductivity (1.51 W/(m·K) − representing 293 % and 50 % improvements over unfilled and randomly dispersed BN systems, respectively). When applied to chip thermal management, the composite reduced operating temperature from 95 to 80 °C, outperforming conventional silicone-based thermal interface material. With its combination of low-cost materials, scalable fabrication process, and superior performance in shape stability, heat absorption and dissipation, this composite system shows exceptional promise for next-generation electronics thermal management.}
