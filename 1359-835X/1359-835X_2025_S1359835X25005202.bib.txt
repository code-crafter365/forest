abstract = {Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites offer high specific strength and stiffness, making them ideal for lightweight aerospace and automotive applications. However, their use is limited by low crack resistance, weak off-axis performance and unreliable failure prediction under static and dynamic loading. This study aims to provide the composite structure with a self-healing feature through a novel microvascular channel mechanism while preserving its mechanical properties and, as a result, to repair micro-sized cracks that occur in its structure. The effect of various channel configurations on mechanical properties of the structure was evaluated with mechanical tests. No significant negative effect on flexural strength was observed. 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (5E2N) in liquid form is used as self-healing agent injected into microvascular channels. The reaction is triggered by Grubbs catalyst, which is dispersed into the matrix of the composite when the crack propagates through the channels. A compact tension test to propagate the crack was performed for different healing times and approaches. According to the experiments, the efficiency has been raised by increasing the healing time up to 120 min for both approaches. Maximum healing efficiencies up to 136 % in the first and 149 % in the second approach were observed.}
