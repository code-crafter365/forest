abstract = {The homogenization methodology used to transmit material behavior across length scales during virtual manufacturing is crucial to developing multiscale process modeling frameworks that minimize the propagation of error across length and time scales. This work proposes a novel cure- and temperature-dependent generalized numerical micromechanics-based approach for multiscale cure process modeling utilizing Representative Volume Elements within a Finite Element (FE) framework that is applicable to arbitrary fiber materials and volume fractions, degree of cure, and processing temperatures. The methodology is based on freezing the microscale process modeling simulation at a given temperature and degree of cure, applying six independent loading configurations, and using the resulting homogenized stress and strain responses to compute the full homogenized stiffness matrix at that specific cure state. The proposed approach is benchmarked against five closed-form solutions and an experimental datapoint. After evaluating all combinations of fiber behavior, fiber volume fraction, matrix cure state, and matrix temperature, the relative error from using closed-form solutions was quantified.}
