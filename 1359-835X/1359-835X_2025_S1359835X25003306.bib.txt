abstract = {Glass fibers, renowned for their high transmissivity, have found widespread application in electromagnetic wave-transparent materials, however, increasingly intricate application scenarios have constrained their further deployment. This study addresses this by developing S-glass/aramid hybrid laminates with tailored symmetric and asymmetric stacking sequences. Asymmetric designs achieve a tensile strength of 501.1 MPa and bending strength of 449.2 MPa, outperforming symmetric counterparts by redistributing stress and suppressing crack propagation. Transmissivity rises to 91.376 %, enhancing radar functionality. These gains, rooted in hybrid effects and interlayer stress modulation, are supported by laminate theory. This work provides a robust framework for designing lightweight, durable radome structures, bridging material innovation with engineering application.}
