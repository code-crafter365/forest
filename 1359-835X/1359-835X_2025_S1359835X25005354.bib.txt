abstract = {Squeeze flow is one of the main deformation mechanisms in SMC compression moulding. This paper presents the development of a rate-dependent plasticity model for simulating the squeeze flow behaviour of a carbon fibre SMC under typical compression moulding conditions. The proposed model focused on the compressive stress–strain response of the SMC, taking into account the coefficient of friction at the SMC/mould interface, the apparent compressibility and the strain rate dependency of the SMC. The model was verified using a single-ply SMC squeeze flow simulation, where the predicted results of compressive force–displacement, the volume change of the SMC, and the in-cavity pressure distributions were compared with the experimental data. The simulation with combined compressibility and pressure-dependent friction gives better prediction in both compressive forces and pressure distribution. Furthermore, a multi-ply squeeze flow simulation was performed to validate the proposed model, and it was found that a more realistic representation of the SMC charge and a more accurate prediction of compressive forces were achieved by modelling the multi-ply charge as separated plies with varying thickness.}
