abstract = {In practical applications, the UV resistance of polyurethane coatings is extremely important in addition to the corrosion protection. Fluorinated polyaniline (FPANI) was generated in situ on the surface of F-d@CeO2 in an acidic environment using phytic acid (PA) as a dopant, and FT-IR, Raman, TG, XRD, and XPS tests showed that the fluorinated polyaniline was chemically bonded to polydopamine. Anti-corrosion experiments showed that the composite coating (PFC5) with the best anti-corrosion properties was when the filler content (FPANIPA/F-d@CeO2) was 5 wt%. The |Z|0.01 Hz of the PFC5 composite coating remained above 108 Ω·cm2 after 120 d of immersion. Cerium oxide, on the other hand, has the ability to absorb and protect from UV light, and fluorinated polyaniline and polydopamine’s free radical scavenging capabilities can trap the free radicals generated by UV-aging polyurethane and inhibit or block the photo-oxidation reaction of the coating. Therefore, the PFC5 composite coating shows excellent UV resistance, with the lowest photo-oxidation index and carbonyl index after UV aging for 300 h, and maintains excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. At the same time, the tests of POM, EIS and mechanical properties show that the PFC5 composite coating exhibits excellent photothermal self-healing performance, and the coating still maintains good mechanical properties as well as anticorrosion properties before and after self-healing, with a self-healing efficiency of more than 90 %.}
