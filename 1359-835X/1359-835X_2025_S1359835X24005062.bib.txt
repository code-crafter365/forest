abstract = {Tailorable discontinuous fiber composite laminates provide relative formability beyond that of continuous fiber laminates, while achieving improved mechanical performance over comparable stochastic systems. In this work, the notch sensitivity of engineered prepreg platelet molded composite (PPMC) laminates is investigated using the open-hole tension (OHT) test and compared to available data for stochastic PPMCs and continuous fiber laminates made with the same material. The press-formed thermoplastic composites (AS4/PEKK) were molded with a quasi-isotropic stacking sequence. The discontinuous PPMC laminate was found to be notch insensitive with OHT strengths ranging from 145.4 MPa (CV = 7%) for d/w=0.5 to 229.3 MPa (CV = 9%) for d/w=0.25. The highly ordered meso-structure of the engineered PPMC laminate yields comparatively excellent mechanical properties for relatively thin laminates in contrast to stochastic systems. Both net- and gross-section failures were observed for d/w=0.25, which suggests that the engineered PPMC laminates studied here maintain a degree of inherent, internal stress concentrations that compete with those caused by geometric features such as a circular hole. Computational simulations of the OHT tests with explicitly represented platelets were found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. The progressive failure analysis was used to conduct a numerical investigation of the stacking sequence and platelet meso-morphology.}
