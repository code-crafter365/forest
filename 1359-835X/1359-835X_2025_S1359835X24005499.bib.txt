abstract = {We prepared a titanium matrix composite (TMC) with added boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) for strength-ductility trade-off issues. The composite, characterized by in-situ nano-TiB intragranular distribution and trace nitrogen solid solution, was prepared using rapid hot press sintering (FHP) and short-duration hot rolling. During pre-rolling heat preservation, the diffusion of boron and nitrogen resulted in the intragranular distribution of nano-TiB and nitrogen solid solution. The nano-TiB demonstrated excellent load transfer, fracture suppression, and dislocation storage capabilities at both room and high temperatures. Coupled with the nitrogen solid solution, the composite exhibited a significant enhancement in strain hardening effect compared to the titanium matrix. The composite outperformed the titanium matrix in strength and ductility at both room and high temperatures, demonstrating a notable strength-ductility synergy. This work provides a reference for designing TMCs with excellent performance at both room and high temperatures.}
