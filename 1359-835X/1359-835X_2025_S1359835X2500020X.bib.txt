abstract = {Developing efficient multifunctional composite polymer materials with excellent flame retardency, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, antibacterial and mechanical strength has been a huge challenge. Here, a nano nanofiller (Ag@PZS@MXene) was synthesized via electrostatic self-assembly and the nanofiller was introduced into ABS matrix to fabricate ABS nanocomposites (ABS-Ag@PZS@MXene). Then, multifunctional hierarchical structural composites ABS-Ag@PZS@MXene/MXene film (ABS-Ag@PZS@MXene/SW) was constructed via air-assisted thermocompression technology. The core–shell structure (Ag@PZS) protects the MXene from oxidation while effectively optimizing the interface between the multifunctional nanofiller and the ABS matrix. Consequently, the obtained hierarchical ABS composites have excellent flame resistance (reduction in peak heat release rate of 36.8 % and peak smoke production rate of 39.1 %) outstanding electromagnetic shielding performance (the EMI SE reached 25.2 dB at 12.4 GHz), superior antibacterial activity and improved mechanical performance. This work supplies a feasible strategy for designing polymer-based composite with excellent multifunctionality, which have a great potential for applications in many fields.}
