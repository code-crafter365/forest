abstract = {The incompatibility of nanomaterials with resin and the irreversibility of coatings after damage severely limit the anti-corrosion and anti-wear properties of epoxy coatings. Hence, in this work, a f-BNNs-ZB@AFD-EP composite coating with active/passive self-healing properties was prepared to provide excellent corrosion and wear protection. Boron nitride nanosheets with a high aspect ratio were prepared by mechanical exfoliation, and their compatibility with resin was enhanced by polyethyleneimine. The release of benzotriazole from the zeolitic imidazolate framework on the nanosheets and the reconnection of disulfide bond provided excellent active/passive self-healing properties. Moreover, the coating resistance of f-BNNs-ZB@AFD-EP (2.49 × 107 Ω⋅cm2) was increased by three orders of magnitude pure epoxy coating (7.95 × 105 Ω⋅cm2). Meanwhile, the friction coefficient (0.64) and wear rate (5.00 × 10−5 mm3/N·m) of f-BNNs-ZB@AFD-EP were lower than that of pure composite coating (0.78, 3.50 × 10−4 mm3/N·m). The f-BNNs-ZB@AFD-EP with outstanding properties has great application prospects in the field of material protection.}
