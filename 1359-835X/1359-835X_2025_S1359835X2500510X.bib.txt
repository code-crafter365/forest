abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) braided composites exhibit superior stability and damage tolerance under complex service conditions, attributed to their intrinsic braided architectures. However, the high-performance of these materials has been significantly hindered by poor machining quality. This study proposes a comprehensive multiscale framework to systematically analyze the machining of 3D braided composites. A machining model based on the spatial architecture of 3D braided composites was developed at the macroscopic scale, enabling precise characterization of cutting-induced damage mechanisms. Cutting mechanisms and parametric structural damage were systematically investigated. When the fiber-tool interaction aligns with the braiding orientation, localized compression-shear stresses drive rapid material fracture. In contrast, at complementary angles, bending-induced stresses dominate, leading to significant pre-fracture deformation and interfacial debonding, accompanied by surface degradation. At the macroscopic scale, the structural damage of three-dimensional braided composites during the machining was studied, through parametric analysis, a cutting depth of 0.2 mm is identified as the optimal machining parameter with a safety factor of 2.0 to ensure structural integrity. The accuracy of the multi-scale models (micro–macro) is validated by the designed experiments. This study establishes a modeling paradigm grounded in multi-scale failure mechanisms, offering a theoretical foundation for the precision machining of braided composites.}
