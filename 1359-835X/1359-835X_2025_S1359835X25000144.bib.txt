abstract = {This study investigates the effect of graphene incorporation into epoxy on its microstructure and energy dissipation properties under vibration loading. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the load-carrying and energy dissipation capabilities of graphene/epoxy nanocomposite models were successfully quantified at the nanoscale. Oscillatory shear deformation analysis revealed that graphene enhances the interfacial energy dissipation under out-of-plane loading, which significantly improves the damping performance of the nanocomposites. However, a detailed spatial analysis of the matrix domain revealed that the interphase around graphene is inferior to that of the bulk matrix in both load-carrying and energy-dissipation capabilities, which is attributed to the locally elevated cross-linking density at the interphase and insufficient interfacial interactions. This encapsulated interphase structure causes a simultaneous increase in deformability and elasticity under external shear strain. The study findings underscore the necessity of optimizing the interfacial structure for developing graphene/epoxy nanocomposites with superior passive vibration damping properties.}
