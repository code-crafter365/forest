abstract = {In this study, Ti6Al4V-Ti5Cu composites with a 3D-interspersed triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structure were fabricated via selective laser melting (SLM) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Microstructural characterization, corrosion resistance, and tribological behavior were systematically investigated. Results show the composite exhibits a homogeneous microstructure with no significant interfacial precipitates. Electrochemical tests reveal that Ti6Al4V-Ti5Cu demonstrates superior corrosion resistance compared to monolithic Ti6Al4V and Ti-5Cu alloys. Notably, the TPMS biomimetic architecture substantially enhances tribological performance, attributed to the lubricating effect of softer Ti-5Cu particles forming a protective layer during wear. This integrated design offers a novel additive manufacturing strategy for repairing dissimilar metal components in engineering applications, combining tribological reinforcement with functional optimization.}
