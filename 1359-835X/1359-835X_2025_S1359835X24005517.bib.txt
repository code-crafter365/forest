abstract = {The preparation of silicone rubber with excellent tracking resistance and flame retardancy is of great significance for application in high-voltage electrical insulation. Unfortunately, to date there lacks an effective strategy to simultaneously endow silicone rubber with satisfied tracking resistance and flame retardancy. In this work, aminopropyltriethoxysilane-modified MXene (APTES-MXene) was prepared by dehydrative condensation between the Si-OH in the hydrolyzed aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and the hydroxyl groups in MXene. The APTES-MXene was homogeneously dispersed in addition-cure liquid silicone rubber (ALSR). The effects of APTES-MXene on the tracking resistance and flame retardancy of ALSR were investigated. Incorporating 0.175 phr APTES-MXene and 15 ppm Pt catalyst enabled ALSR to pass 1A4.5 level, with a low erosion rate of only 0.29 %, indicating a significantly improved tracking resistance. Meanwhile, the 0.175 phr APTES-MXene also endowed ALSR a UL-94 V-0 rating and the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value reached 32.8 %. It was found that APTES-MXene and Pt catalyst synergistically promoted ALSR forming ceramic layer at elevated temperature. The mechanism for APTES-MXene improving the tracking resistance of ALSR was also proposed. This work provided new insights for high performance high-voltage insulation silicone rubber.}
