abstract = {The direct soldering of high-volume-fraction SiC particle–reinforced Al metal matrix composites (SiCp/Al-MMCs) at low temperatures is challenging due to required simultaneous wetting and bonding of Al matrix and SiC particles. In this study, 55 vol% SiCp/Al-MMCs were ultrasonic-assisted soldered in air using an active Sn–Ag–Cu–Al solder at 250 ℃. The deposition reaction occurred of the Al in solder and O from air to form a transition layer of Al2O3 between the Al matrix and solder. A composite transition layer of MgAl2O4 + Al2O3 formed between the SiC and solder under localized and transient high temperatures induced by the ultrasonic cavitation effect. The thermodynamic calculation revealed the interfacial reaction mechanism between the SiO2 on the SiC surface and active elements (Al and Mg) from the Al matrix based on acoustic pressure simulation results. The bonding interface structures ensured a high joint shear strength of 52.1 MPa with only 20 s of ultrasound action.}
