abstract = {The integration of superior flame retardancy and enhanced thermal conductivity of epoxy resins (EP) is highly desirable for practical applications. Herein, novel organophosphorus-decorated MXene hybrid flame retardant (PMXene) was prepared by the interface engineering between melamine diphenylphosphinate (MDP) and two-dimensional titanium carbide (MXene). With the loading of 6.0 wt% PMXene, the EP/6.0PMXene material achieved a V-0 rating during the UL 94 testing besides the high limiting oxygen index (35.2 %). Cone calorimetric results revealed that the peak of heat release, peak of smoke release rate and smoke factor values of EP/6.0PMXene were reduced by 36.6 %, 27.6 % and 48.6 %, respectively, in comparison with those of pristine EP. Besides, the PMXene hybrid enhanced the thermal conductivity of EP to 0.38 W/m·K, a 52.0 % improvement over pristine EP. Thus, this work provides a novel strategy for fabricating thermosetting materials with high fire-safety and enhanced thermal conductivity.}
