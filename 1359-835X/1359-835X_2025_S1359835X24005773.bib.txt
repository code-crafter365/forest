abstract = {Impact-resistant materials frequently encounter inherent trade-offs among damping, toughness, light weighting and strength. This study employed laser 3D printing combined with spark plasma sintering techniques to fabricate a novel biomimetic composites of CoCrFeNiMn/Ti6Al4V lattice structure with B4C/AlSi10Mg interpenetrating phase, showing the potential application of this composite as a novel impact-resistant material. Experimental results demonstrated that the composites exhibited outstanding compressive strength and strain energy absorption, attributed to their intricate interpenetrating dual-phase structure and interface bonding mechanism. The interpenetrating phase structure and the formation of interface nano-Ti3AlSi5 phases promote effective stress transfer within the composite material, resisting the propagation of local damage. During mechanical loading, cracks originating in the CoCrFeNiMn/Ti6Al4V lattice were mechanically interlocked by B4C/AlSi10Mg infiltration, thereby conferring heightened strengthening efficacy and exceptional damage tolerance. Effects of strain rate (10−3/s to 1/s) and temperature (from room temperature to 300 °C) on dynamic impact performance of the composites indicated a very competitive strain rate hardening and thermal softening performance.}
