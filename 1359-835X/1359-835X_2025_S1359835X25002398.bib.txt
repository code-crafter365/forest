abstract = {A two-step femtosecond laser rotary drilling (FLRD) method is proposed to address the difficulty combining the quality and processing efficiency of small holes in SiCf/SiC composites. The laser fluence line and mesh analysis methods are proposed to grasp the distribution of laser fluence in the drilling and finishing process, reveal the formation mechanism of the tapered blind hole profile, and elucidate the evolution of the small hole profile from tapered blind hole to tapered base-hole and then to nearly taper-free hole. In 50 s, a hole with a diameter of 300 µm, an aspect ratio of 10, and a taper of 0.03° was achieved.The hole profiles at different feed depths were consistent with the predicted results, which verified the validity of the hole profile model. The hole profile formation mechanism of FLRD is revealed, which provides theoretical support for the processing of cooling holes in SiCf/SiC composites.}
