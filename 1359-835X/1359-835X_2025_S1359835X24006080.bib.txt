abstract = {The edge effect phenomenon in cross-ply laminates made of ultra-thin (UT) 90º plies produces a relevant stress component through the laminate thickness that could lead to the generation of longitudinal debonds (parallel to the loading direction) in the 90° ply block. In this study, specimens from a carbon-epoxy laminate made of conventional 0º and UT 90º ply blocks are inspected after the curing process in order to find longitudinal debonds. The debonds growth is also monitored during a later T-T cyclic testing campaign. The experimental results are compared with the predictions obtained from a BEM model showing a good agreement. Finally, the use of an inverse procedure combining both experimental and numerical analyses leads to the estimation of GIc of the fibre/matrix interface.}
