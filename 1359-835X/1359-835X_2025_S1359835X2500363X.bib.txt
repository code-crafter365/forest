abstract = {This study proposed a modified 3D Solid Orthotropic Material with Penalization (SOMP) topology optimization method specifically designed for 3D shell structures made of continuous fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs), while considering the manufacturing constraints associated with 3D printing. The optimization results demonstrated that proposed method effectively aligns the fiber orientations of the designed topological structures parallel to each predetermined slice layer. This alignment ensures feasibility in path planning, thereby facilitating the 3D printing of the optimized CFRC shell structures. Then, an arched CFRC shell structure was optimized using the proposed modified 3D SOMP method and fabricated with a multi-axis 3D printer following a continuous fiber printing trajectory derived from an offset path planning approach. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the global stiffnesses of these 3D-printed CFRC shell structures are in agreements with the numerical results obtained after topology optimization with a discrepancy of 12.7%. This demonstrates a strong alignment between the optimization design and the manufacture.}
