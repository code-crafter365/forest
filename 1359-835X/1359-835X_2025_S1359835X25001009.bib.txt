abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tube is utilized in large aperture deployable space antennas for its superior material properties. Impact damages on CFRP tube can significantly impair the load-bearing capacity of the tubes. Efficient and convenient non-destructive evaluation method of impact damage in CFRP tubes is essential. This study develops a high-frequency eddy current testing (HF ECT) finite element analysis method that accounts for both the dielectric properties and anisotropic conductivity of CFRP, and establishes a fiber bundle model that explains the operating mechanism of displacement current and eddy currents in CFRP, offering guidance for predicting HF ECT signals in CFRP. A high signal-to-noise ratio mutual differential Bobbin probe is developed specifically for detecting impact damage in CFRP tubes. A HF ECT experiment system is constructed and validated using impact damages induced by a force hammer, demonstrating the effectiveness of method and probe, and the invisible impact defect is detected successfully.}
