abstract = {Encouraging advancement in the ultrasonic welding of thermoset composites (TSCs) was recently achieved by co-curing weldable thermoplastic coupling layers (CLs) onto their surfaces. However, obvious temperature inhomogeneity at the welding interface easily leads to thermally decomposition of epoxy matrix and irreparable defects in the welds. This study proposed a strategy for producing high-quality ultrasonically-welded TSC joints by utilizing novel-structured thermoplastic meshes as energy directors (EDs). Compared to prevalent film EDs, the usage of mesh EDs significantly promoted the heat generation efficiency and temperature distribution uniformity at welding interfaces. The maximum temperature of TSCs reached during welding processes decreased from 373.7 °C to 216.7 °C with reduced welding time by 32.4 %. These phenomena effectively prevented thermally decomposed epoxy matrix, and resulted in high-quality welding lines with remarkable lap-shear strength, i.e. reaching a maximum value of 31.1 MPa. Overall, this study presents a promising strategy for developing robust TSC joints by tailoring ED structures.}
