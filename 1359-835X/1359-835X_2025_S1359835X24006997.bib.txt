abstract = {This paper introduces an additive manufacturing (AM) approach by integrating a coaxial photopolymer composite extruder with a robotic manipulator. Specimens made of continuous Kevlar fiber-reinforced PLA, with about 30 % fiber volume content, were manufactured by coaxial photopolymer extruder (CPCE) and compression molding (CMPC) for comparison purposes. Test results showed that the tensile properties of the robotic extrusion specimens were comparable to those produced through compression molding techniques. Specifically, the difference in tensile strength, modulus, and elongation at break between the specimen sets were 0.4 %, 7.5 %, and 1.3 %, respectively. Furthermore, testing and analysis using optical and scanning electron microscopy revealed that CPCE specimens exhibited 45% less void content than CMPC specimens. The proposed CPCE method demonstrates mechanical performance comparable to, and in some cases superior to, AM-manufactured Kevlar-reinforced composites in the literature. Additionally, this method provides enhanced design flexibility, reduced design-to-manufacture time, and lower void content than compression molding.}
