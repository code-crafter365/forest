abstract = {Continuous induction welding is an efficient joining technology, particularly for thermoplastic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRPC) structures. A major influence on the quality of induction welded joints is the temperature distribution in the joining zone. However, this temperature depends on a multitude of factors and is not easy to predict without the use of advanced numerical modeling techniques. Although such models of the induction welding process exist, they usually come with simple material models and high calculation times. Within this study, a fast and accurate numerical modeling approach for the induction welding of CFRPC, was developed and extensively validated by means of coupon-level induction welding trials. The simulation approach presented in this work was able to provide an accurate quantitative and qualitative prediction of the temperature development in the joining zone and laminate surface. Compared with state-of-the-art fully coupled induction welding models, the computation time reduced by approximately 95% further increases the viability of such simulations for industrial-scale applications.}
