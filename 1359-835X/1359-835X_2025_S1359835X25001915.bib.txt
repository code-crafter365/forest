abstract = {This paper presents the design of the sub-laminate under the concept of the double-double composite using the data-driven method. As the key advantage of the double-double composites is the reduced repeat number of sub-laminates necessary to achieve homogeneity, it is therefore crucial to determine the best pattern of sub-laminates which ensures the optimal lightweight design with the minimum thickness. In the data-driven framework, first, a generative neural network model was built for generating the sub-laminates fitting in the scope of the homogeneous criterion. Then, a symbolic regression model was built for quantitatively finding the hidden layup patterns in the dataset of these sub-laminates. It is found that the form of double-double and triple-double stands out in the vast design space of all the possible layup sequences. The 4-layer sub-laminate of [θ/−β/β/−θ] and 6-layer sub-laminate of [θ/−β/−γ/+γ/+β/−θ] are most recommended as they meet the homogeneous criterion with less thickness and offer larger design space of mechanical properties. The established data-driven framework can be extended to other scenarios especially in finding the common design rules of laminates.}
