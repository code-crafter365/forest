abstract = {Polymeric composites integrating large dielectric constant (ε), minimal loss with elevated breakdown strength (Eb) and thermal conductivity (TC), exhibit concern in electrical and power industry. To enhance the TC and Eb while suppressing loss in silicon (Si)/poly (vinylidene fluoride, PVDF), the Si@silica (SiO2) was prepared by high-temperature oxidation, and subsequently doped into PVDF. The Si@SiO2/PVDF displays lower loss since the SiO2 layer prevents direct contact between Si particles， inhibiting long-distance electron migration. Moreover, the SiO2 introduces traps to immobilize charge carriers, elevating the Eb. In particular, changing the amorphous SiO2 shell to crystalline one accelerates phonon transport, leading to enhanced TC. The dielectric parameters and TC of the Si@SiO2/PVDF can be synergistically tuned by adjusting the SiO2′ morphology and thickness. The theoretical calculation uncovers the underlying mechanisms for both charge and phonon transport in the composites. This developed Si@SiO2/PVDF composites with excellent dielectric performances and large TC showcase widespread applications.}
