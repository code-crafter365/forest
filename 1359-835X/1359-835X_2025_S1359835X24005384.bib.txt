abstract = {Automated tape placement (ATP) process is widely used in aerospace for its advanced process control and multi-axis capabilities but faces issues like limited choice of materials and suboptimal tape consolidation. This study investigates air plasma treatment on ATP carbon fiber thermoplastic feedstock tape to address these challenges. The effects on low melt Polyaryletherketone/carbon fiber unidirectional tape (LMPAEK/CF UD tape) were analyzed. Treated and untreated tapes were used to fabricate composites and evaluated for physical, thermal, mechanical, and interfacial properties. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses revealed surface roughness changes (on LMPAEK), extent of oxidation, and the presence of hydroxyl/carboxyl groups. Composites from plasma-treated tapes showed a 7.6% increase in tensile strength, 8% in tensile modulus, 18% in flexural strength, and 8.3% in flexural modulus. The interlaminar shear strength improved by 18.7%. Failure analysis showed untreated composites failed via inter-ply and fiber-matrix delamination, while treated composites experienced matrix cracking and fiber breakage. This study highlights atmospheric plasma treatment as a solution to ATP’s limitations, significantly enhancing LMPAEK/CF UD tape composites’ properties.}
