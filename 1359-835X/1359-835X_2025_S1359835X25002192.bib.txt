abstract = {Real-time in-service structural health monitoring (SHM) of AFP-manufactured parts is essential for preventing catastrophic structural failures. The self-sensing performance and damage-monitoring capabilities of CF/PEEK tape were evaluated, revealing a bilinear sensing curve with sensitivity coefficients of 8.667 and 4.526. Building on these findings, a real-time SHM method based on the in-layer self-sensing capabilities of key tapes was proposed, which enabled the monitoring of multiple key positions under various working conditions. Furthermore, aiming at the weak interlayer quality of AFP-manufactured parts, the method’s ability to detect delamination and other failure modes was validated by monitoring through-thickness resistance. Finally, two prospective cases were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method in monitoring the working state during the internal pressure expansion process and the potential of identifying the load position based on the sensing tape array. This method provides a cost-effective way for real-time monitoring the in-service working state of AFP-manufactured parts.}
