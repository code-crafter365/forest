abstract = {Fiber metal laminates (FMLs) are extensively used in large aero components, such as aircraft skins and fuselages. In this study, the thickness of conventional FMLs components are reduced to the micron level, and the deformation behaviors of ultra-thin laminates are investigated thoroughly. These investigations will broaden the applications of FMLs in micro-systems. FMLs formability is a primary factor limiting their widespread applications. While the material flow stress can be reduced substantially through ultrasound-assisted forming with improved formability. Currently, most research on ultrasound-assisted forming is focused on metal micro-forming. Limited studies have addressed the enhancement mechanisms of ultra-thin FMLs. This study focused on developing an ultrasound-assisted test setup. The low-constraint ultra-thin industrial pure titanium grade 1 (TA1)/carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates are prepared through the interlayer adhesive film addition method. The tensile deformation behavior of laminates is examined by comparing tensile strength, elongation and reduced stress values under various amplitudes, lay-up angles, geometries and grain sizes. The damage mechanisms of laminates under ultrasound assistance are explored through surface and interlayer micro-morphological analyses. The study explains the low-constraint deformation of ultra-thin FMLs under the combined influence of ultrasound assistance and scale effects, thereby providing a theoretical foundation and technical support for ultra-thin FMLs application in the micro-device sector.}
