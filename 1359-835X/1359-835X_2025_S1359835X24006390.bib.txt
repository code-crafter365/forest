abstract = {Superalloy honeycomb structures have been widely used in aerospace components due to its excellent mechanical and physical performances. Electrochemical grinding offers great potential in reducing honeycomb core defects. However, the porous characteristics pose new machining challenges like excessive corrosion. Herein, the vortex effect generated by the honeycomb pores was investigated to restrain excessive corrosion, thereby effectively improving the honeycomb surface quality. Simulation results indicate that the flow field on honeycomb surfaces significantly differ from solid surfaces, with the electrolyte injection angle playing a crucial role in influencing the vortex effect. The electrolyte injection angle of 50° has been optimized to enhance the vortex effect, which promote the residue accumulation and reduce excessive corrosion. Experimental results demonstrate that the maximum excessive corrosion depth can be significantly reduced from around 70 μm to less than 20 μm. This research provides valuable insights into leveraging the vortex effect for advanced honeycomb components.}
