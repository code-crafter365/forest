abstract = {Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) in mechanical mode, Raman and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscopy were applied to explore the ultrastructure and nano-mechanical properties of kink-band regions in flax fibres. It is evidenced, that the longitudinal indentation modulus drastically drops (between −43 and −53%) in kink-band regions, mainly explained by pronounced changes in microfibrillar angle (MFA), from 0 to 6° to 19-21°. At contrary, Raman investigations demonstrate a conservation of biochemical composition, along with a decrease in local crystallinity (between 11 and 57%), contributing also to the mechanical loss in kink-band regions. These micro-scale investigations provide inedited findings about the kink-band features and specificities, especially in term of local properties.}
