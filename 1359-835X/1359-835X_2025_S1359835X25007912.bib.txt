abstract = {Magneto-dielectric synergistic engineering, offering tunable electromagnetic parameters and microstructural versatility, has emerged as a powerful strategy for optimizing electromagnetic-wave (EMW) attenuation; drawing on bio-inspired design cues to tailor functional structures plays a pivotal role in countering current electromagnetic pollution. However, fabricating heterointerface-engineered architectures with strong polarization capability to optimize impedance matching and elucidate loss mechanisms remains challenging. In this study, a multilayered heterostructured MXene@PANI@CoNi-LDH composite was fabricated via electrostatic self-assembly followed by hydrothermal secondary growth; PANI serves as a bridging moiety that tunes the dielectric constant, while the introduction of urchin-like CoNi-LDH not only captures more EMW but also intensifies the synergistic polarization relaxation within the system. Experimental results demonstrate that the MPCN-2 sample achieves a minimum RL of −68.27 dB at 1.8 mm and a maximum bandwidth of 4.24 GHz at 1.1 mm, accomplishing highly efficient EMW absorption. Moreover, the radar cross-section (RCS =  −38.18 dB m2) fully confirms its substantial potential for practical applications. This work offers guidance for achieving strong absorption and tailoring functional architectures in MXene-based composite devices.}
