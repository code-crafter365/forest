abstract = {Early corrosion detection beneath coatings and damage repair presents a significant technical challenge, highlighting the urgent need for rapid non-destructive detection methods and active self-healing technologies. In this work, a smart coating with timely self-reporting and self-healing functions was developed by integrating a composite (TPMP) into an epoxy coating. The TPMP consists of a pH/Fe3+-dual responsive lanthanide metal–organic framework and a PDA-modified nanocontainer. The composite is pH-sensitive, enabling precise localization of corrosion areas through fluorescence quenching while simultaneously releasing corrosion inhibitors for protection. An epoxy coating doped with 0.2 wt% TPMP obtained an improvement in corrosion performance and inhibited the spread of corrosion from the damaged area effectively. Compared to the EIS method, the TPMP/WEP coating could detecte the corrosion damage within 30 min, exhibiting fast response, higher sensitivity and free from the interference of coating color.}
