abstract = {Carbon nanotubes/aluminum (CNTs/Al) composites have great potentials due to their light weight, outstanding mechanical and electrical properties. It is easy to enhance the mechanical strength of the CNTs/Al composites, but very difficult to improve the electrical properties. Here, CNTs/Al composites are prepared by powder metallurgy (PM) and friction stir processing (FSP) followed by hot press, respectively. The interface reaction between CNTs and Al inside the composites are investigated. Some new hexagonal compounds consist of Al, C and some O are frequently detected in the CNTs/Al composites. The atomic ratio of Al to C in these compounds deviates from 4:3, indicates that there might be some non-Al4C3 phase aluminum carbide in the composites. Atomic diffusion between C and Al matrix are observed in the composite prepared by FSP and hot press under high pressure, which also results in some hexagonal compounds. The CNTs/Al-FSP composite containing ∼4 wt.% CNTs prepared by FSP combined with hot press behave a superior electrical conductivity of 38.4 MS/m, which is slightly higher than that of the commercial pure Al (AA 1060). The tensile strength and total elongation of CNTs/Al-FSP composite had improved by 28.7% and 15.3% compared with AA 1060, which is attributed to tightly bonded CNTs/Al interface.}
