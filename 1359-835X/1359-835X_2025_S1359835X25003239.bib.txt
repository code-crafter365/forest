abstract = {Natural fiber reinforced composites (NFRCs) are gaining attention in automotive applications as an alternative to glass fiber composites due to their lightweight and renewable sourcing. However, the inherent hydrophilicity of natural fibers leads to poor compatibility with hydrophobic polymers which adversely affects the mechanical properties of the composites and can limit their application to non-structural parts. Sizing is a common approach used for synthetic fibers to improve the interface between fiber and matrix. However, there is limited study on the sizing of natural fibers, and hence the focus of this work. In this study, two different approaches to sizing discontinuous coir fibers were investigated, namely; (1) ex-situ sizing and (2) in-situ sizing. A commercial polypropylene (PP) based sizing agent was used and the effects of varying sizing solution concentrations (1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 wt%) on the properties of the composites was studied. Results showed that composites prepared via the in-situ sizing process had better fiber–matrix adhesion and improved tensile properties compared to ex-situ sized composites. On studying the effect of different sizing concentrations on composite properties, we found that the tensile strength of the composites increased (by ∼ 42 %) up to 2.5 wt% sizing concentration (in solution) and then decreased. However, the impact strength decreased significantly on increasing the sizing content beyond 1.5 wt% (by ∼ 40 %). Additionally, the study was further extended to investigate the effect of sizing on different NFRCs (coir, banana, and cottonized hemp fiber) where effectiveness of sizing was found to be influenced by the fiber surface morphology.}
