abstract = {Designing damage-tolerant fibre-reinforced polymer structures is of fundamental importance if the entire potential of composite materials is to be exploited. Tougher interfaces can be achieved by promoting fibre bridging, which consists of ligaments crossing between crack faces to provide a crack tip shielding effect. This paper presents a multi-scale numerical framework that simulates fibre bridging in unidirectional laminates undergoing mixed-mode delamination, using a discrete model approach for the fibres. In total, five studies are performed. In the first study, the simulation framework is validated by replicating experimental resistance curves from the literature, where the numerical simulation can predict the macroscopic response of the specimen. Additionally, four parametric studies are conducted where the aim is to improve the understanding of the underlying fracture and damage mechanisms and to offer guidelines for enhancing the fracture toughness of a generalized interface. The parametric studies result in three readily usable and generalized recommendations for design and process engineers: the crack tip shielding effect of fibre bridging can be promoted by reducing the average diameter of the bridging fibre bundles, increasing the compliance of the bridging ligaments, or increasing their maximum strength before failure.}
