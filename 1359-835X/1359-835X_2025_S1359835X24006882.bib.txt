abstract = {In order to improve the thermal, mechanical, and tribological properties of epoxy-based (EP) composites, short carbon fiber/carbon nanotubes (CF/CNTs) multiscale reinforcement was constructed by a non-destructive rare-earth modification method. The results of SEM, AFM, FTIR, XPS, and Raman of CF/CNTs multiscale reinforcement showed that this method successfully achieved high-density grafting of CNTs on the CF surface through coordination bonding without damaging its surface structure, which increased the surface roughness of CF from 18.43 nm to 61.31 nm. The results of XRD, TGA, tensile, and reciprocating sliding tribological experiments showed that CF/CNTs multiscale reinforcement has excellent effects on enhancing the range of short-range order structure, thermal, mechanical, and tribological properties of the EP matrix. In summary, this novel chemical grafting method for constructing CF/CNTs multiscale reinforcement offers several advantages, including non-destructiveness, easy operationality, low cost, and environmental friendliness.}
