abstract = {Under impact loading, Al/PTFE reactive materials demonstrate notable strain rate sensitivity and impact-induced ignition. To investigate the influence of impact velocity, Al/PTFE composites (26.5 %/73.5 %) with 35 μm Al particles were synthesized and subjected to quasi-static and dynamic compression experiments. Results revealed a bilinear logarithmic relationship between stress and strain rate. A two-stage simplified Johnson-Cook (JC) model was calibrated to determine its mechanical properties and the parameters were validated by numerical simulations matching the experimental results. Extended simulations analyzed a wide range of strain rate sensitivities and established a dynamic increase factor (DIF) formulation that accurately describes the dynamic mechanical response of the material. These findings provide a robust basis for material selection and performance prediction, supported by comparisons with existing literature.}
