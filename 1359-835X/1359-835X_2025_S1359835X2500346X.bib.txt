abstract = {Manufacturing defect in carbon fiber reinforced polymers pose a major challenge to clarification of the weakening mechanism, duo to their various types, shapes, and multi-scale characteristics. In this study, a three-dimensional computed tomography was utilized to create void’s model and then conducts multi-scale analysis using the homogenization method. In details, a mesoscopic model is developed by millimeter-scale voids, where the material properties derived from homogenization calculations of a micro-scale model containing voids, fibers, and resins. Comparing against theoretical calculations and conventional representative volume element methods demonstrates that the proposed multi-scale approach offers higher accuracy in predicting the mechanical behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polymers with voids (the error within 5% of experimental results). Additionally, a significant direction-dependent modulus weakening mechanism caused by voids was revealed, which is determined by distribution laws and morphology of voids, can provide valuable insights for designing and evaluating carbon fiber reinforced polymers structures.}
