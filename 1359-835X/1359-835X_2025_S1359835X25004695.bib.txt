abstract = {Conductive elastomers are widely used in flexible electronics for real-time deformation monitoring through their resistance response signals. However, conventional conductive elastomers often exhibit shoulder peak effects in these signals, significantly compromising the stability of the monitoring process. In this study, the linear cross-linked structure of the elastomer (SR) was transformed into a spiderweb-like network(SRHT) using polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMS). Meanwhile, anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) were introduced to form a double-charge layer on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), enabling the construction of a spiderweb-like conductive elastomer with a double-charge layer (ASR). This structure generated a synergistic mechanism of electrostatic repulsion and spatial potential resistance, effectively preventing agglomeration in SRHT. Experimental results showed that ASR reduced the resistance response hysteresis area by 36.79 %, eliminating the shoulder peak effect in the resistive response signal. A combination of experimental analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was used to investigate the origin of the shoulder peak effect and its suppression mechanism. Additionally, ASR exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, with tensile strength and elongation at break increasing by 49.93 % and 62.8 %, respectively. The material demonstrated excellent strain-sensing performance, achieving a high gauge factor (GF) of 2390.29 and a response time of 222 ms. ASR has great application prospects in aerospace, flexible electronics, intelligent monitoring and other fields.}
