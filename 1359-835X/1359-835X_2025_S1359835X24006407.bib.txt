abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a typical anisotropic additive manufacturing technology, planning the printing path by utilizing reasonably this anisotropy can enhance effectively the mechanical properties of the printed parts under external loads. However, the traditional methods that focus solely on geometric factors in printing path planning can hardly consider this anisotropy, failing to laying the printing path along the principal stress directions, resulting in the printed parts being prone to fracture under the given load. To solve this problem and fully enhance the mechanical properties of printed parts, a principal stress direction-aware streamlined printing path planning method is proposed in this paper. It involves deriving the principal stress direction field (PSDF) from finite element analysis, analytically reconstructing the stream function based on the PSDF, and extracting its isoline, i.e., streamline, as the potential printing path. Moreover, a framework of generating streamlines for the printed parts with irregular features is developed through the proposed PSDF interpolation and streamline trimming methods. Once the streamlines are generated, the printing path is planned by employing a customized strategy to effectively control the nozzle jump distances, thereby improving the printing efficiency. Three specimens with different features are fabricated and tested to validate the proposed method. Compared to the traditional contour and zigzag printing paths, the streamlined printing path can yield a mechanical property enhancement of printed parts by 20.9% to 216.3%, even at comparable or lower filling rates. This highlights the potential of the proposed method as a promising candidate for actual industrial applications.}
