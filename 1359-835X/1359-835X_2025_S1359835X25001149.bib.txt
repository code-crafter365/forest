abstract = {This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) technique that co-trains neural networks (NNs) that represent each function in a system of equations to simultaneously solve equations representing an out-of-autoclave (OOA) cure process while conducting optimization in adherence to process requirements. Specifically, this co-training approach benefits from using NNs to represent OOA inputs (air temperature profile) and outputs (part and tool temperature profiles and degree of cure). Production requirements can then be levied on the inputs, such as maximum air temperature and minimum cure cycle, and simultaneously on the outputs, such as degree of cure, maximum part temperature, and part temperature rate limits. Co-training the NNs results in an optimized input producing outputs that meet all OOA process requirements. The technique is validated with finite element (FE) simulations and physical experiments for curing a Toray T830H-6 K/3900-2D composite panel. Hence, this novel approach efficiently models and optimizes the OOA cure process.}
