abstract = {High-end electronic materials need reliable thermal and friction resistance. Here, a self-lubricating and highly thermally conductivity polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) composite was prepared by surface optimization strategy combined multidimensional network. One-dimensional SiC whiskers (SiCws) and two-dimensional BN nanosheets (BNNS) nanoparticles were modified using modified layers formed by in-situ polymerization of PDA and PEI to obtain SiCws-BNNS@PDA-PEI heterostructure fillers with multifunctionality. Then, PEN-based composite films were fabricated by investigating different phase species and filling ratios. The results show that thermal conductivity of multi-component PEN/SiCws-BNNS@PDA-PEI (2.92 W/m.K) composite is 189.11 % higher than that of pure PEN, and coefficient of friction (0.17) and specific wear rate (1.28 × 10−5 mm3/(N.m) are 45.16 % and 87.57 % lower than pure PEN respectively. And, correlation between thermal and friction behavior is explained.}
