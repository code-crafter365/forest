abstract = {In this paper we investigate the influence of soft magnetic particle mass fraction on the multi-physics field of proposed magnetorheological (MR) gel clutch. A novel MR gel clutch with complex cup-shaped gap is described, whose performance is based on the relative placement between Halbach array arrangement and MR gel. Smart MR gel with 40 wt%, 50 wt%, 60 wt%, 70 wt% and 80 wt% of soft magnetic particles used as the transfer medium and Halbach array is adopted as magnetic excitation system. Its magnetic/mechanical analysis is carried out based on Bingham-plastics model using COMSOL Multiphysics software, which takes into account the variation of dynamic viscosity with magnetic flux density. The distribution of the magnetic flux density, shear yield stress, post-yield viscosity, shear stress and torque in the four flow channels during the transition from engagement state to disengagement state are obtained and analyzed in detail. Multi-physics field characteristics of proposed MR gel clutch with five kinds of MR gels are studied and compared in order to give some useful suggestions in the design phase. Finally, the dynamic torque of the MR clutch with different MR gel is experimentally evaluated.}
