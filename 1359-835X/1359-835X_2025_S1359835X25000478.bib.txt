abstract = {There has been an increasing emphasis on sustainability research in selective adsorption materials for treating contaminated solutions, since these materials come with great attributes of chemical polarity, physical durability, and environmental friendliness. In this study, we coated multifunction biomass-derived polyurethane (BPU) and petroleum-derived polyurethane (CPU) with Fe3O4 NPs, stearic acid (SA), and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) to increase their mentioned attributes. The proposed foams exhibit outstanding flame retardancy, superhydrophobicity, adsorption capacity, oil–water separation ability, and recyclability, meeting the demands of oily wastewater remediation. Accordingly, the modified BPU foam demonstrates a water contact angle (WCA) of 144.5° (124 % higher compared to BPU), maintaining an adsorption capacity of 12 times after 10 cycles. Meanwhile, the modified CPU achieved a superhydrophobic state with a WCA exceeding 150.1° (40 % higher compared to CPU), and its adsorption capacity was maintained at 17 g/g after 10 cycles. Demulsification efficiency reached 84 % and 88 % for BPU@Fe3O4@SA and CPU@Fe3O4@SA, respectively. Furthermore, the foam materials in the presence of TPP flame retardant show a high flame resistance that can extinguish flame within 2 s after removing a flame torch, which underscores its robustness and fire safety in practical applications. Finally, the comprehensive comparisons and characterization performances between BPU-based and CPU-based foams were first introduced in this investigation. The findings affirm the sustainable and promising foam derived from bamboo biomass, contributing not only to environmental applications but also to broader sustainable development.}
