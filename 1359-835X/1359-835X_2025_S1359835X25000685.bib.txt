abstract = {We developed a novel solid–liquid composite coating with a gradient distribution of liquid-like brush grafting polysilazane and well-distributed modified graphene oxide, integrating anti-corrosion and underwater anti-adhesion properties, which exhibits stale anti-fouling and drag reduction properties. The corrosion current of the coating decreases by six orders of magnitude compared to that of the substrate, and it has an extremely long salt spray lifespan of over 1440 h with the thickness approximately 20 μm. It also achieves over 97 % reduction in microbial contamination, and the maximum drag reduction rate reaches about 36 %, exhibiting outstanding antifouling and drag reduction performance. Impressively, the drag reduction rate remains very stable even after the corrosion test, followed by algae adhesion tests and after abrasion. Even the coating is worn, it can still maintain relatively stable protective performance. This work provides a novel and feasible method for the engineering application of ocean antifouling and drag reduction.}
