abstract = {In this paper, core-sheath fibers with poly(styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene) triblock copolymer (SEBS) as the core layer and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) of different molecular weights as the sheath layer were prepared by coaxial electrospinning. Amphiphilic triblock copolymers were added to the SEBS core layer, and the fusion of incompatible SEBS-PVP at the core-sheath interface was further promoted by appropriate solvent post-treatment. Polydopamine (PDA) was in situ polymerized on the surface of SEBS-PVP fibers, so that silver nanowires (AgNWs) with high aspect ratios were conformally self-assembled along the fibers to form good interfacial bonding, so that the SEBS-PVP/AgNW composite membrane has high conductivity and exhibits good interfacial transfer effect in cyclic stretching under large strain. Based on core-sheath nanofibers and self-assembly, the excellent interfacial transfer gives SEBS-PVP/AgNW low viscoelastic loss, integrated large tensile strain sensing and stable Joule heating effect, which is conducive to the development and application of multifunctional stretchable electronics.}
