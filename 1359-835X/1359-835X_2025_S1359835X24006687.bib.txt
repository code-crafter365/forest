abstract = {High-fidelity finite element (FE) models have been applied to simulate the mechanical properties of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composites, which include a novel polybenzoxazine matrix resin designed for space applications. FE analysis was used to construct a digital model that replicates the geometry of the plain-woven fabric composite structure, employing X-ray computed tomography data to detail the quality of the composite laminate (manufactured with a thickness of 3.00 mm and fibre volume fraction of 53.0 %). The simulation results are in agreement with experimental data: the simulated tensile modulus (69.2 GPa) closely matches the experimental result (68.8 GPa), and this comparative analysis is also agreeable for the tensile strength (493 MPa simulated, 485 MPa experimental), flexural modulus (48.8 GPa simulated, 48.7 GPa experimental), flexural strength (554 MPa simulated, 526 MPa experimental), compressive modulus (4.20 GPa simulated, 4.00 GPa experimental), and compressive strength (328 MPa simulated, 335 MPa experimental).}
