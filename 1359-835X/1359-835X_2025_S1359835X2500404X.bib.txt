abstract = {Nanomaterials arranged in three-dimensional architectures have been explored to mitigate agglomeration and enhance the thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties of polymer composites. Freeze-drying is a scalable and cost-effective method to create foams with high tailorability. Subsequent infiltration of these foams with high-temperature polymer resins results in nanocomposites exhibiting multiple high-performance properties, suitable for diverse applications including the aerospace industry. This study investigates and compares the thermal, electrical, neutron shielding, and tribological properties of high-temperature epoxy/graphene (GNP), epoxy/hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN), and hybrid GNP/hBN foams. The thermal conductivity of epoxy/GNP and epoxy/75:25 GNP:hBN foams was found to be more than five times higher than that of neat epoxy. Additionally, the epoxy matrix, initially an insulator, became electrically conductive with the presence of a GNP network, achieving a conductivity of 0.79 S cm−1. Epoxy/hBN composites demonstrated the highest radiation shielding, nearly doubling the mass absorption coefficient compared to neat epoxy. These findings underscore the potential of interconnected nanomaterial structures to enhance the properties of polymer matrices, providing efficient pathways for heat and electrical conduction. In this study, GNP lamellae primarily form these pathways, with hBN particles sitting on top due to their smaller diameter. While the addition of nanomaterials improves various properties of the epoxy matrix, this study emphasizes the importance of application-specific optimization to maximize the most relevant properties.}
