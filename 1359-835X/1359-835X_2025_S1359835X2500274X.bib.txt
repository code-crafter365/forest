abstract = {Passive radiative cooling (PRC) smart windows have been studied in the energy-saving field due to their superior cooling effect. However, developing low-cost interfacial microstructures that can be manufactured on a large scale and achieving effective radiative cooling remains a challenge. Herein, a PRC smart window is proposed based on Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC), which possess rich phase-separated structures. Results demonstrate that fluorinated crosslinkers and acrylate monomers can significantly improve electro-optical properties. The PDLC smart window can dynamically regulate the transmittance of near-infrared (NIR) bands, resulting in a maximum temperature difference of 4.12 °C compared to the control sample. Meanwhile, the high emissivity in mid-infrared band enables it to attain a theoretical maximum daytime cooling power of 73.38 W/m2 and a nighttime cooling rate of 122.84 W/m2. Therefore, it is anticipated that our research findings can provide new ideas for the development of PRC and energy-saving materials.}
