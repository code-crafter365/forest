abstract = {Extreme misalignment and high-load conditions in journal bearings pose significant challenges for structural design and material optimization, particularly in high-performance industrial applications. In this study, a numerical lubrication model is integrated with the probabilistic fiber-reinforced composite modeling to evaluate the adaptability of CF/PEEK-coated journal bearings under severe operating conditions. The fiber orientation relative to the sliding direction dictates the elastic modulus of CF/PEEK coatings, influencing its deformation behavior and subsequently modifying the lubrication characteristics. This controlled deformation mechanism enhances lubrication performance by increasing oil film thickness and reducing peak pressure, thereby improving adaptability under high eccentricity and misalignment. Specifically, perpendicularly aligned fibers increase the film thickness to 4.8 µm, with a 30 % improvement at an eccentricity of 0.8 and a misalignment degree of 0.8. The relationship between fiber orientation and lubrication characteristics reveals that fiber-aligned coatings help mitigate peak pressure concentrations and enable greater film thickness. These findings highlight the role of fiber-orientation-driven deformation in improving the operational capabilities of composite-coated bearings, providing a systematic approach to designing fiber-reinforced coatings for next-generation tribological applications.}
