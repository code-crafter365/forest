abstract = {The preparation process and microstructure of ceramic bone scaffolds are crucial for their performance. In this study, we fabricated biomimetic hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds with TPMS structures using desktop-level DLP through process optimization and enhanced their degradation and biological performance by adjusting microstructure using 58S bioglass doping. The Grid porous scaffold exhibited an optimal compressive strength of 26.32 MPa at sintering temperature of 1300 °C and solid content of 55 wt%, while Schwarz-P TPMS scaffold achieved 33.52 MPa. XRD and SEM analyses revealed that 58S reacted with HA during sintering, forming new phases and altering the microstructure, thereby influencing the performance of the HA scaffolds. The degradation properties and release rates of bioactive ions, including silicon, calcium, and phosphate, were improved, enhancing the biomineralization and cell responses of the scaffolds. This study demonstrates the potential of doping-induced reactions and phase transitions in adjusting microstructure and performance of ceramic bone scaffolds.}
