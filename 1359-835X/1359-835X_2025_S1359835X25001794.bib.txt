abstract = {Woven fabrics are widely employed to enhance the mechanical properties and shape memory performance of shape memory polymers (SMPs). Although prior research has extensively investigated the effects of fiber fraction and laminate architectures on the thermomechanical properties of woven fabric reinforced shape memory polymer composites (WFR-SMPCs), the mechanistic understanding of mesoscale architectural features, particularly how woven textures influence the mechanical properties and shape memory behavior of SMPCs, remains inadequately explored. This investigation pioneers a mesostructure-driven design paradigm, correlating woven textures with shape memory anisotropy through mechanical testing and shape memory performance test. Three types of WFR-SMPCs were created using different woven carbon fiber fabrics (plain, twill, and satin) combined with an epoxy-based SMP. Microstructure analyses of these fabrics and their composites were performed. Uniaxial tensile tests explored the mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of WFR-SMPCs in both fixed and programmable states, thereby assessing the impact of different woven textures on their mechanical properties. Additionally, bending deformation-recovery experiments assessed the shape memory performance, revealing how weave texture influences this characteristic. The experimental results indicated that woven fabric reinforcement markedly improves the mechanical properties of SMP. Variations in tow interlacing across weave types led to differing mechanical properties and shape memory performance in both (0/90) and (±45) orientations. This research offers critical insights for optimizing the design and application of WFR-SMPCs in engineering contexts.}
