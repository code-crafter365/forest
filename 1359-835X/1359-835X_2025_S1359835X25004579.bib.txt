abstract = {Although GPN, graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with polyaniline (PANI), was employed in various fields, the interfacial properties of GPN nanocomposites have not been conducted. Herein, experimental and computational research was undertaken to explore the interfacial properties of GPN nanocomposites by changing the morphology of the GO plane. In the experimental section, the tensile properties were obtained. The strength, modulus, and elongation at break increased as PANI density increased. Even though the elongation at break was reduced compared to pure resin, the strength and modulus increased compared to pure resin in the SV-GPN-AN2 sample. Then, the pull-out simulation was conducted to investigate interfacial behavior in the molecular dynamics (MD) section. The load-transfer capability increased as the PANI grafted density increased, which was consistent with the experimental result. Also, the stress concentration effect was reduced as PANI grafted density increased, which explained why the elongation at break increased when PANI density increased. The elongation at the break value of nanocomposites was lower than that of the pure resin’s break value. Because the nanocomposite properties were illustrated using both experimental and computational methods simultaneously, this study will serve as an indicator for designing nanofillers for nanocomposite materials, and it can offer insight into how interfacial behavior affects macro-scale properties.}
