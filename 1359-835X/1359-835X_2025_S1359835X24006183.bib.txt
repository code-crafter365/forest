abstract = {We introduce a novel, rapid, and environmentally friendly method for synthesising reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/ZnO nanocomposite. This single-step synthesis involves the pyrolytic decomposition of sucrose to produce rGO, simultaneously with zinc acetate to produce the rGO/ZnO nanocomposite. Unlike conventional methods, this approach is distinguished by its environmental sustainability, avoiding the use of toxic chemicals and generating no harmful byproducts. This method advances the development of sustainable technologies by providing a green alternative for the cost-effective production of rGO/ZnO composites from inexpensive precursors. The process enables bulk production within minutes, making it suitable for industrial-scale applications. Various characterisation techniques confirmed the successful formation of rGO and rGO/ZnO nanocomposites. The materials were then evaluated for their efficacy as a comprehensive water purification solution, demonstrating effectiveness in heavy metal removal, photodegradation of organic pollutants, and bacterial disinfection.}
