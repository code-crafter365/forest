abstract = {High mechanical load-carrying capability and oxidation resistance performance are crucial to structural materials used in extreme conditions. However, these features are often difficult to achieve simultaneously in conventional graphite/ceramic composites. Herein, inspired by the structural–functional feature of plant cells, the biomimetic cellular-structured SiC-B4C reinforced graphite microbead (G@SiC-B4C) composites are fabricated via Si-mediated reactive spark plasma sintering (RSPS), achieving co-enhanced mechanical robustness and adaptive oxidation resistance. By coupling three-dimensional continuous ceramic cytoderm with well-bonded phase interface, the composites yield exceptional flexural strength (222 MPa) and fracture toughness (3.79 MPa·m1/2) at optimized ceramic contents (9 vol% B4C, 30 vol% SiC). Temperature-adaptive oxidation resistance is mediated by dynamic oxide layers: B4C-derived B2O3 seals defects below 1200 °C, reducing mass loss rate by 83 % (0.52 → 0.09 mg·cm−2·h−1), while SiC-generated SiO2 dominates protection above 1200 °C. Dual-stage oxidation kinetics at 1400 °C, initial parabolic O2 diffusion through damaged B2O3 oxide layer, followed by linear reaction-controlled kinetics governed by stabilized SiO2 barrier, demonstrate component adaptability. Optimal B4C content (9–14 vol%) balances intermediate-temperature self-sealing via B2O3 layer and high-temperature self-healing through SiO2 barrier. The biomimetic dual-phase ceramic reinforced graphite composites establish a paradigm for extreme-environment structural materials in aerospace and nuclear systems.}
