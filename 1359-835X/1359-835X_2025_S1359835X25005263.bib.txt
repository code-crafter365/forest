abstract = {Attaining a highly efficient fire retardancy and multi-functionality of polymeric materials via a catalysis of metal–organic framework remains a magnificent challenge. Taking advantage of the multi-metal-element catalytic complementarity and the interface reaction strengthening, we ingeniously designed a sandwich-like core-dot-shell ZrAA@Fe@ZIF-67 micro-porous hierarchy. Relative to the counterparts, a low-loading incorporation of 2 wt% ZrAA@Fe@ZIF-67 endowed epoxy with UL-94V-1 rating and a 32.4 % reduction of peak heat release rate. An exceptional catalytic conversion of CO effluent to CO2 was evidenced towards a 84.0 % suppressed ratio of CO/CO2 production rate. Additionally, a UL-94V-0 rating was achieved through an integration of 2 wt% ZrAA@Fe@ZIF-67 and 3 wt% commercialized organophosphorus. Due to a reaction-strengthening interface design, the impact strength was enhanced by 52.3 %, significantly outperforming the counterparts. The glass transition temperature was improved by 21 °C in dynamic mechanical analysis. An insightful fire-retardant mechanism investigation demonstrated a featured tandem and combined catalytic charring behavior induced by multi-metal sites and featured core-dot-shell micro-porous structure towards optimizing the fire char microstructure. Prospectively, a hierarchical design of metal–organic framework with tandem catalysis exploits a facile yet effective approach towards multi-functional fire-safe polymers.}
