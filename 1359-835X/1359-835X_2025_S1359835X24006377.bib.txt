abstract = {This study delved into the significant effects of fiber dispersion and aggregation on the nonlinear mechanical properties of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites, aiming to advance fiber dispersion control and elucidate specific advantages to mechanical properties. In contrast to the conventional method of preparing composite materials using powdered CNF and solid anhydrous maleic anhydride PP (MAPP), we proposed an innovative method that used water-dispersed CNF and water-dispersible MAPP to enhance fiber dispersion. Morphological analysis of fiber aggregation was conducted using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), complemented by mechanical testing through tensile strength evaluations. The results demonstrated that the proposed preparation method enhanced both fiber dispersion and mechanical properties. Applying multiscale simulations based on homogenization theory, we developed a two-step homogenization process for fiber agglomeration modeling, which incorporated fiber dispersion measurements from X-ray CT. Numerical analysis accurately replicated the phenomena observed in experiments, confirming the validity of the modeling approach and elucidating the integrity of the developed cellulose composite materials. Additionally, by introducing parameters: aggregation domain (k) and aggregation density (x), we quantified the impact of fiber agglomeration on the nonlinear mechanical properties of the composites and provided design guidelines for fiber dispersion control. This study not only proposed a method for creating cellulose composite materials with excellent fiber dispersion but also provided a systematic multiscale numerical analysis method based on experimental measurements to evaluate mechanical properties considering fiber agglomeration.}
