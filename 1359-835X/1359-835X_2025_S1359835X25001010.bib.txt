abstract = {Graphene has attracted attention in the field of electromagnetic stealth due to its excellent electrical properties. In this work, we first describe how microwave absorption properties can be enhanced by using graphene to construct heterogeneous interfaces and structural defects through conventional composite preparation methods. Meanwhile, the infrared stealth performance is discussed by tuning the charge density and Fermi energy levels of graphene as well as by constructing three-dimensional porous structures. Then, the current state of research on microwave and infrared stealth based on metamaterials and metasurface structure design strategies is reviewed. In addition, the research progress of radar-infrared compatible stealth technology using three strategies of material composite, metamaterial and metasurface structure design is summarized. Finally, the advantages and limitations of graphene-based stealth materials prepared using different strategies are analyzed, as well as the current challenges.}
