abstract = {The creation of wearable protection materials with optimal overall performance is essential to meet the requirements of nuclear workers. Here, multilayer composites with “interlocked structure” were prepared by vacuum filtration and layer-by-layer assembly using Ta4C3TX MXene as filling, multi-crosslinked elastomers as matrix, and abrasive cloths as templates. To enhance the scattering attenuation, we constructed an alternating structure from two levels. When the template was 60 mesh, composites exhibited tensile strength at 8.95 MPa, tearing resistance at 72.59 N, and pull-out strength at 5.16 MPa. Gauge factor reached 19.41. Furthermore, the temperature of the composites could rise up to 88.5°C under a load of 1 sun and 1 V voltage, the mass attenuation coefficient for 59.6 KeV γ-rays was found to be 0.927 cm2/g. These indicate that the composites have excellent behavioural monitoring, thermal management and radiation protection capabilities, and have a wide range of applications within low-temperature nuclear environments.}
