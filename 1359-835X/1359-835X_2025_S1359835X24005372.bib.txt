abstract = {In this paper, a fatigue model is formulated and implemented to predict fatigue life of fiber reinforced composite laminates. The developed model is based on experimental data collected at different spatial and temporal scales, and reported in [1] and [2]. The model is first validated against quasistatic tensile test data and is shown to accurately capture damage modes and the sequences in which the modes occur. Next the fatigue damage model is formulated and for computational efficiency the cycle jumping approach is used to implement the model for predicting fatigue life. The computational efficiency is further enhanced through the use of a neural network that allows for very fast computation. Details of the model are presented and shown to be an efficient way to predict fatigue life of composite laminates.}
