abstract = {This study investigates the dynamic characteristics of composite laminated magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) sandwich plates, both with and without graphene in theMRE core. First, the composite laminated face sheets, MRE core, and graphene-reinforced MRE (GMRE) core are prepared. Then laminated composite MRE sandwich plates (MRESP) and graphene-reinforced MRE sandwich plates (GMRESP) are fabricated, and the natural frequencies of the sandwich plates are determined experimentally with various magnetic fields under clamped-free (CF) boundary conditions. The governing differential equations for the composite laminated MRESP and GMRESP are derived using classical laminated plate theory (CLPT) and solved using Lagrange formulation. Numerical simulation has been conducted using MATLAB, results are validated with experimental results and available literature. Further, the influence of various parameters on MRESP and GMRESP dynamic behaviour was investigated.The GMRESP and MRESP natural frequencies exhibit an increase of 30.29 % and 26.51 %, respectively, as the magnetic field increased from 0 G to 300 G.}
