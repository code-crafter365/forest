abstract = {This study delves into the bending performance and morphological alterations of preforms subjected to various forming process parameters. A comprehensive experimental apparatus has been devised to quantitatively assess bending performance in thinner composite preforms, tailored to characterize bending behaviour and interlayer sliding phenomena. Preform specimens, prepared under diverse parameters, underwent tests to elucidate performance characteristics. The interplay between interlayer sliding and process parameter variation during bending was explored. Micro-CT scans of preforms before and after bending uncovered the impact of parameters on bending performance and interlayer sliding. Leveraging experimental data, a convolutional neural network-based prediction model for bending force resistance and an interlayer sliding slope prediction model were formulated. The results revealed MAE and MSE values below 0.1. A predictive model with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.9 accurately forecasts bending performance and interlayer sliding, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and offering profound insights into the post-forming process.}
