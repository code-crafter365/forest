abstract = {An alternative route to the traditional scutching and hackling processes was tested to produce hemp fibres suitable for load bearing composites. A classical approach consisting of a succession of breaking roller and breaking card, was used. The morphology and mechanical properties of the fibres were characterised. The tensile properties after breaking card, extra finishing card and combing were comparable to those obtained from the traditional approach. This similarity may be attributed to the drawing process which serves to homogenise the fibre properties by mitigating the number and severity of structural defects. This, combined with the possibility of using a more flexible approach than scutching and hackling may present an opportunity to increase the European production of technical fibres for load bearing applications. This would satisfy industries seeking large quantities of high potential fibres, a demand that cannot be adequately met by the textile flax resources which are increasingly diverted to the garment industry.}
