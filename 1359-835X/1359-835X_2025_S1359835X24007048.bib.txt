abstract = {Improving the mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with carbon nanotubes has been a challenge due to the lack of control over the distribution and orientation of carbon nanotubes during composite processing. Here we present a novel approach of utilizing a dielectric block to polarize and align interlayer CNTs by applying a bipolar nanosecond pulse superimposed direct current bias (nsPDC) electric field during the curing process of CFRP laminates. The addition of 0.05 wt% multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) resulted in a 138% increase in the initial crack extension and a remarkable 139% increase in the steady state. Based on the microscopic characterization of the fracture surface and the crack extension path, the significant increase in mode I fracture toughness was attributed to the enhancement of the interface and the bridging effect of the aligned carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, testing of the in-plane properties demonstrated no loss and even slight enhancements. The results of this study open up new opportunities for developing composites with significantly enhanced properties.}
