abstract = {Insulation is crucial for improving the energy efficiency of buildings, as it effectively reduces heat transfer and optimizes energy usage. Insulations are challenging to replace due to their installation within the walls, necessitating long-term durability. The demand for insulation with enhanced performance for sustainability is driving the development of high-performance insulations. Adding graphite filler is one approach to improving the thermal performance of insulation. However, the effect of graphite filler on insulation in the long term needs to be clarified. In this work, the morphological and chemical changes caused by the degradation of two types (over-time and water vapor induced) of insulations {extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) and XPS with added graphite}. A comparison of XPS and XPS with added graphite filler showed that XPS with added graphite filler was more stable against degradation. These results suggest the possibility that the addition of graphite to XPS makes it more resistant to degradation.}
