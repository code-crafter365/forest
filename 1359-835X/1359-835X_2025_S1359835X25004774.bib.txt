abstract = {The complex geometry of two-dimensional triaxially braided composites (2DTBCs) leads to distinct damage patterns and crack propagation under high-speed impacts. Temperature rises during high-speed impacts were significantly higher than those in quasi-static and low-speed tests, with the distribution strongly influenced by the braided structure. This study investigates the thermodynamic response of 8-layer 2DTBC plates impacted by titanium alloy projectiles, using a high-speed infrared camera and impact testing platform. Experimental results showed local temperatures exceeding 120 ℃, with severe fiber breakage at the temperature profile center. A mesoscale finite element (Meso-FE) model, incorporating braided architecture and thermomechanical interactions, was developed to explore thermal failure mechanisms. Validated at 89.6 m/s, the model revealed that non-penetrated plates exhibited larger out-of-plane displacements and matrix cracking, while penetrated plates showed higher temperature increases. Energy dissipation analysis indicated that bias fiber bundle fracture contributed most to temperature rise, followed by axial fibers and matrix deformation.}
