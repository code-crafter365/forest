abstract = {The manufacturing of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites demands rapid and energy-efficient strategies. Frontal polymerization (FP) enables the manufacturing of CFRP using dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) thermoset polymer which meets these requirements. In this work, we introduce reactive extrusion of CFRP (RE-CFRP), where two rollers provide localized heat and pressure to sustain the curing reaction and the consolidation of a continuous carbon fiber tow pre-impregnated with DCPD. We study the effect of the extrusion speed, temperature, and compaction force on the properties of the produced CFRP. Mechanical testing confirms that the resulting fiber volume fraction and the elastic modulus are similar to bulk cured tows. A homogenized thermo-chemical model is developed to study the effect of the process parameters on the polymerization reaction. The process produces hollow woven composite tubes directly via extrusion and in situ curing. Overall, this process offers advantages in curing, tooling, speed, and energy.}
