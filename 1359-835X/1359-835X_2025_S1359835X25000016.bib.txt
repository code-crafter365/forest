abstract = {Resistance to atomic oxygen (AO) and electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a critical property of polymers such as polyimide (PI), essential for ensuring the long-term service of spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO). Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) coatings exhibit excellent flexibility and AO protection properties due to their packed layer structure and inherent AO stability. However, the poor electroconductibility of LDHs inevitably leads to ESD failures, limiting their practical lifespan. In this study, we composited reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with LDHs nanosheets, creating conductive laminated heterostructures. This coating demonstrated a reduced resistance of 1.17 × 107 Ω/sq, effectively meeting the requirements for ESD protection. Moreover, it showed outstanding comprehensive properties, including exceptional AO protection performance (an erosion yield of 1.0 × 10−25 cm3/atom under 4.35 × 1020 atoms/cm2), good flexibility and adhesion. This proposed strategy offers a solution for enhancing the conductivity of flexible inorganic coatings, and expands the potential applications in AO resistance and other areas.}
