abstract = {Aramid paper laminates, as promising all-solid-state insulating materials, are increasingly in demand for high-power transformers in future renewable energy systems. However, the weak interface interaction between paper layers and epoxy resin presents a major challenge in achieving superior mechanical and insulating properties. In this study, we propose an interface tailoring strategy utilizing silane linkages with amino and epoxy terminal groups to enhance resin-layer interactions, leading to a simultaneous improvement in interface breakdown strength (30%) and tensile strength (80%) in the composite laminates. The mechanism of interface modification can be attributed to multi-scale physical processes. Strengthened hydrogen bonding interactions between aramid paper and epoxy resin facilitate the impregnation process, followed by covalent bonding with the resin matrix, thereby reinforcing the laminate structure. Additionally, this strategy effectively reduces the dielectric constant and loss while suppressing space charge accumulation. The introduction of silane linkages disrupts the electronic conjugation effect within aramid molecules, increasing the band gap and elevating the interface energy barrier to impede leakage current and electrical breakdown. The effectiveness of this approach was validated through designed interface discharge experiments, providing theoretical insights for the development of high-performance all-solid-state insulating materials.}
