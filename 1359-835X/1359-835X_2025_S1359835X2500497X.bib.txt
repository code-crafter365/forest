abstract = {The performance of conventional sound absorbing materials are often affected by temperature variations, leading to frequency drift or performance degradation. In this study, we propose a temperature-insensitive, broadband acoustic absorbing structure that operates over a wide temperature range, termed the high-temperature acoustic porous metasurface (HAPM). The HAPM is composed of mullite fiber porous layers bonded to a ceramic sheet skeleton. Numerical and experimental results validate the wave manipulation and its temperature dependence, showing good agreement with the theoretically predicted reflection angles. Compared to conventional uniform porous layers of 40 mm and 80 mm thickness, the HAPMs achieve consistently higher sound absorption at equivalent thicknesses above 5000 Hz and 2000 Hz, respectively. Analysis of the period length and porosity of fibrous material reveals that the key factor for wide-temperature-range absorption is the subunit phase gradient, rather than the energy dissipation by the porous material within a specific subunit. This porous structure design provides a reliable reference for high-temperature acoustic absorption applications.}
