abstract = {A sustainable and flame-retardant composite facing layers was developed using recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) fiber-mats and renewable soybean oil-based resins. The rPET fiber-mats were surface-treated with a finishing agent composed of paraformaldehyde and dicyandiamide. This finishing agent can interact with the fiber surface both physically and chemically, aiming to enhance composite interfacial adhesion. A flame-retardant soybean oil-based resin, from epoxidized soybean oil, tannic acid, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate phosphate, was used as the matrix. The composites exhibited a limited oxygen index of 28.68 %, with reduced heat release and flue gas emission during combustion. The treatment of rPET fibers contributed to improvements in thermal and mechanical properties of the composites. When used as outer layers, this composite also enhanced both flame retardancy and mechanical performance of the paper honeycomb panels. This study introduces an innovative approach to replacing traditional nonrenewable and flammable facing layers in honeycomb panels with recycled and renewable materials.}
