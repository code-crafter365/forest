abstract = {In this paper, in-situ dielectric properties of GFRPs with different fiber orientation angles of 0°, 15°, 30° and 45°, are investigated under combined electrical and mechanical tensile stresses. The results show that there is a nonlinear relationship between the dielectric polarization and mechanical stress. This is attributed to the competitive processes between the enhanced interfacial polarization and introduction of more cavities under high stress level. The dielectric loss of GFRPs reaches the maximum for 45° samples under 60% tensile stress, with an increase of 27.25%. Compared to 0° samples, the influence of tensile stress on the partial discharge and breakdown strength becomes more significant when the orientation angle is above 30°, indicating interface debonding has become the dominant role in material damage. Understanding the evolution of damage behaviors and dielectric properties under different fiber orientations is of great significance to optimize material design and improve electrical insulation performance of GFRPs.}
