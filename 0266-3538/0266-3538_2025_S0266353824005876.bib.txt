abstract = {Polyimide (PI) with ultralow dielectric constant (Dk) and dielectric loss (Df) is highly desired for high-frequency and high-speed electromagnetic communications. Herein, PIfm/PI composites with excellent dielectric and hydrophobic properties were successfully prepared by impregnating an electrospun PI nanofiber membrane (PIfm) with polyamic acid (PAA) solutions prior to re-imidization process. Evenly distribution of impregnated PAA in the PIfm endows the imitated PI matrix to bind with PI fibers tightly. The abundant internal stress at the interfaces of PI nanofibers and PI matrix results in a higher chain packing density, which greatly inhabits dipole polarization in the PIfm/PI composites. Specifically, the PIfm/PI-15% composite demonstrates an average ultralow Dk of 1.756 and Df of 0.004 in high-frequency range (8.2–12.4 GHz), together with a quite high dielectric breakdown strength reaching 226.47 kV mm−1 and sufficient tensile strength of 40.3 MPa. The Td5% is higher than 560 °C while keeping the coefficient of linear thermal expansion lower than 50 ppm °C−1. Moreover, the PIfm/PI composites possess a hydrophobic property with contact angle above 108.0°, ensuring the dielectric stability even in a high-temperature or humid environment. The obtained fluorine-free PIfm/PI composites with excellent dielectric and hydrophobic properties via electrospinning-impregnation method will greatly boost the advancement of PI nanofiber composites in high-frequency applications.}
