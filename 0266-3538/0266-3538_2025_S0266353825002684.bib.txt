abstract = {Smart composites based on shape memory polymers (SMPs) offer significant promise for adaptive and responsive systems in applications such as soft robotics, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices. However, the broader applicability of SMPs is limited by inherently low mechanical strength, electrical conductivity and thermal performance. To overcome these challenges without requiring complex chemical modifications or processing, we developed a multiscale-fiber embedded hybrid shape memory polymer composite (mSMC), by incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polyethylene-coated cellulose microfibers (CMFs) into shape memory polymer matrices. By optimizing the CNTs-to-CMFs ratio through chemorheological and multifunctional analyses, we achieved substantial enhancements in tensile strength, electrical conductivity, heat transfer, and shape memory-recovery behavior. Notably, the 2:1 formulation dramatically boosted performance, yielding a 2.71-fold increase in tensile strength, a 4.95-fold rise in elastic modulus, and a 1.63-fold gain in toughness, while maintaining stable electrical conductivity (∼10−3 S/m). Additionally, it demonstrated a 4.98% faster heat transfer rate and a 7.56% higher shape recovery ratio compared to the pure SMP. Rheological monitoring revealed the optimized composition accelerated stable network formation, which may contribute to the observed improvements in mechanical properties. These enhancements are primarily attributed to a tri-phase mechanical interlocking mechanism among CNTs, CMFs, and polymer chains, which promotes efficient load transfer and cohesive multiscale architecture. Furthermore, mSMC enabled applications including microwave-triggered actuation, thermoresponsive sensors, and soft actuators lifting 215% of their weight. This study introduces a scalable, rheology-guided strategy for engineering multifunctional SMP composites, advancing the frontiers of programmable materials for intelligent, high-performance devices.}
