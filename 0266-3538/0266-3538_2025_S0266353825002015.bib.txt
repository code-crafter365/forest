abstract = {Epoxy composites were prepared by varying the amounts of tungsten tetraboride, tungsten monoboride, and ditungsten pentaboride as reinforcing microparticles. These composites were subsequently tested for their radiation shielding performance and mechanical properties to evaluate their potential in nuclear applications. Gamma-ray and thermal neutron attenuation capabilities, along with mechanical behavior, were systematically characterized. Gamma-ray measurements showed enhanced shielding with increased tungsten content, particularly at lower photon energies, with tungsten monoboride–epoxy composites exhibiting superior attenuation due to the highest tungsten concentration among the selected borides. Neutron attenuation tests confirmed that increasing filler content reduced neutron transmission effectively. Material's hardness improved with filler content, indicating enhanced load-bearing capacity, while tensile testing revealed increased stiffness but reduced tensile strength and ductility at higher filler contents. The effects of irradiation were also examined, showing that the composites retained mechanical integrity under radiation exposure. Reinforcing epoxy matrices with tungsten borides significantly improved radiation shielding against gamma rays and neutrons while enhancing mechanical performance. These findings highlight the potential of tungsten borides -epoxy composites as lightweight materials for advanced radiation protection applications.}
