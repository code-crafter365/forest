abstract = {The design and fabrication of piezoelectric materials with exceptional thermal stability for application in harsh environments remains a challenging. Herein, a three-dimensional porous fluorine-containing polyimide (PI) and zinc oxide (ZnO) composite self-powered piezoelectric sensor with high sensitivity and high-temperature resistance is prepared via the water vapor-induced fast phase separation method. The increased interface area within the PI film can produce enhanced piezoelectric properties by introducing a porous structure. The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of pure porous PI-0 film reached 3.3 pC/N. In addition, the addition of ZnO nanoparticles significantly improved the piezoelectric properties and thermal stability of composite porous films. The as-prepared sensor exhibits good piezoelectric characteristics with a voltage output of 4 V, excellent piezoelectric sensitivity (0.75 V∙N−1), fast response (15 ms), recovery time (20 ms) and outstanding durability (>9000 times). Furthermore, the composite porous PI films exhibit high flexibility, hydrophobicity, excellent high-temperature resistance with Td5% up to 500°C. This study represents a novel kind of piezoelectric substrate for the design of high-performance self-powered piezoelectric sensors in aerospace and microelectronics.}
