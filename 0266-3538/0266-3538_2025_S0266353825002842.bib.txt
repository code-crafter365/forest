abstract = {A fatigue progressive damage model considering the loading interaction is introduced to predict the combined high and low cycle fatigue (CCF) life and residual fatigue properties of composite laminates. This model incorporates fatigue failure criteria, fatigue damage evolution, residual property degradation and a normalized fatigue life model. By considering the interaction between low cycle fatigue (LCF) and high cycle fatigue (HCF), the cumulative fatigue damage under the CCF loading is calculated, and the models for residual stiffness and strength are improved accordingly. A comprehensive fatigue simulation procedure is established to perform equivalent treatment on the combined fatigue loads and calculate the fatigue life. Experimental tests on LCF and CCF are carried out to validate the accuracy of the proposed model, and the simulated results demonstrate good consistency with the experimental results. Moreover, the key parameters in CCF, such as the stress amplitude ratio of CCF, frequency ratio of CCF and stress ratio of LCF, are discussed in terms of their effects on fatigue life and residual stiffness.}
