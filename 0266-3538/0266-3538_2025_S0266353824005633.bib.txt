abstract = {With the widespread application of highly integrated and high-frequency power devices in the electronics field, traditional electronic packaging materials can no longer effectively resist the harm caused by electromagnetic interference and heat accumulation to electronic equipment. To address these challenges, we have successfully constructed a heterostructure-rich dual-level three-dimensional (3D) network framework (MoS2/CMF) by effectively integrating molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with carbonized melamine foam (CMF). These fillers were then composited with epoxy resin (EP) to develop MoS2/CMF/EP composites exhibiting both electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) and enhanced thermal conductivity. Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 nanosheets with a 1T/2H-phase structure uniformly grew on the surface of CMF, improving the poor impedance characteristics of the 3D carbon structure and increasing heterointerfaces and multiple scattering abilities. Owing to the synergistic effects of attenuation performance and impedance matching, the EP-based MoS2/CMF-1 composite demonstrated an impressive reflection loss value of −64.80 dB and an effective absorption bandwidth of 8.48 GHz, achieved with only a 5 wt% loading. Correspondingly, CST simulation results indicated that when electromagnetic waves are vertically incident on MoS2/CMF-1/EP samples, the radar cross-section (RCS) attenuation value can reach up to 35.4 dBm2. Moreover, the highly interconnected 3D carbon structure of CMF provides broad pathways for phonon transport, resulting in the thermal conductivity of MoS2/CMF-1/EP reaching 0.41 W/m·K at room temperature, a nearly 141 % improvement compared to pure EP. This multifunctional EP-based composite, with its high-efficiency EMA and thermal management performance, shows great potential for application in the packaging of highly integrated electronic devices.}
