abstract = {The thermo-oxidative aging resistance of polysiloxane elastomers can be improved by dispersing CeO2, a common heat stabilizer, within the elastomer matrix. However, this approach is limited by the small specific surface area of commercial CeO2 and inefficient dispersion methods. To overcome these issues, fly-ash-based porous calcium silicate (PCS) as a CeO2 carrier is introduced in this study. Using the CeO2-loaded PCS-reinforced fillers fabricated via a solvothermal method, a series of silicone rubber composites are prepared. The effect of thermos-oxidative aging on the mechanical properties and network structures of composites with various filler compositions and CeO2 loadings are analyzed. The micromorphologies and microstructures of the composites and the CeO2 mechanism of action are investigated using scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After 12 h at 300 °C, the PCS-filled silicon rubber composites loaded with CeO2 exhibit superior mechanical properties and thermos-oxidative aging resistance than the composites to which CeO2 is directly added. This enhancement is partly attributed to the substitution of micro-PCS by nano-CeO2 and to the uniform distribution of CeO2 on the surface and between the layers of PCS. The uniform dispersion of CeO2 increases the specific surface area of the filler, thereby promoting filler–polymer interactions. Furthermore, the trapping of free radicals by Ce4+ inhibits the thermo-oxidative aging of the composites. The proposed CeO2-loaded PCS-reinforced filler can be used in developing silicone rubber composites suitable for high-temperature applications.}
