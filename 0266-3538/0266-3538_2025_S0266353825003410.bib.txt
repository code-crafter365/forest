abstract = {Achieving effective shielding against high-power electromagnetic pulses (HEMPs) without compromising mass is critical for aerospace, defence and wearable systems, yet remains elusive for most lightweight materials. In this work, we present a multifunctional composite aerogel constructed from aramid nanofibers (ANFs), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), and MXene nanosheets. A dual-network architecture is formed through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, yielding a highly porous structure with integrated strength, flexibility, and electrical functionality. The aerogel exhibits an exceptional compressive stress of 0.48 MPa at 60 % strain, broadband shielding effectiveness exceeding 90 dB in the X-band (with >90 % absorption contribution), and thermal stability up to 150 °C. Conventional shielding metrics based on continuous-wave (CW) frequency-domain evaluations often fail to capture material behavior under such scenarios. To evaluate the aerogel's transient protection capabilities, we further employed time-domain shielding effectiveness (TDSE) simulations based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling. The results confirm strong suppression of electric field peaks, derivatives, and energy flux under EMP-like illumination, demonstrating the aerogel's viability in pulse-rich environments such as aerospace and defense systems. This study offers a versatile and scalable platform for engineering aerogels with high-performance electromagnetic resilience, bridging the gap between material design and real-world operational requirements.}
