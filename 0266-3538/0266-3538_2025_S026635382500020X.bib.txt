abstract = {The miniaturization of electronic components and logic circuits has led to a significant increase in power consumption and heat generation. To ensure safe and reliable operation, there is an urgent demand for high-performance thermal interface materials (TIM) to facilitate effective heat dissipation. Although phase change materials (PCM) exhibit desirable properties, such as heat storage and temperature control, they face challenges, including low thermal conductivity and potential leakage during utilization. Herein, we prepared graphene oxide (GO) coated n-docosane particles using the Pickering emulsion template method, followed by the deposition of a silver layer on the surface to produce double-shell D-GO@Ag microcapsules, which enhanced the thermal conductivity while preventing leakage. By incorporating these microcapsules into silicone rubber, we successfully developed a highly thermally conductive PDMS/D-GO@25Ag composite, exhibiting a phase change enthalpy of 65.69 J/g and a thermal conductivity of 0.61 W/(m·K), along with excellent compliance properties. When utilized as a TIM, this composite significantly reduces device operating temperatures while maintaining strong stability. This work presents a promising strategy for developing multifunctional, thermally conductive elastomer-based PCM for efficient thermal management.}
