abstract = {Biobased multifunctional composites with graphene-like fillers can be widely used in various industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and energy industries. Such organic‒inorganic composites containing biomaterials currently suffer from prolonged fabrication processes and limited functionality. Herein, a biobased composite that incorporates in situ reduced graphene oxide (RGO) onto a carbon fiber mat (CFM) is presented, which is rapidly combined with biobased polyamide (PA56) under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions to maintain the structural integrity of the three-dimensional network within the matrix, thereby enhancing its electrical and mechanical properties. As a result of these strategies, the biobased RGO/CFM/PA56 composite demonstrates significantly enhanced electrical heating performance (5 V, 126 °C) and electromagnetic shielding capability (76 dB, 0.74 mm), which is among the highest values reported for existing biobased composite materials. Furthermore, the material exhibited notable thermoelectric properties, characterized by a value of −25.3 μV K−1. Notably, the modified composite demonstrates rapid thermal forming capabilities and possesses welding characteristics facilitated by PA56, enabling it to be recyclable and reusable. After rapid repair, the mechanical performance of the samples remains at approximately 80 %, whereas the other functionalities are maintained above 90 %. This study is the first to report biobased PA56/carbon fiber mat composites, highlighting their benefits in various applications and providing a fresh perspective on sustainable and high-performance biobased composites.}
