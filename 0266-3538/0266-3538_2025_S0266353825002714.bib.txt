abstract = {This paper investigates the tensile behavior and failure modes of triaxial woven fabric composites under multi-angle uniaxial stress. Tensile tests were conducted at off-axis angles of 0°, 15° and 30°, utilizing digital image correlation technology to capture full-field strain distributions of specimens, enabling the monitoring of damage initiation and propagation processes to study the effect of fabric structure on composite tensile properties. A full-scale mesoscopic finite element damage model was developed, which retained the geometric features of the fabric at the macroscopic scale and incorporated the inter-yarn bonding effects between yarns. The numerical simulations showed good agreement with experimental results. The findings indicate that the stiffness differences of three sets of specimens in the linear elastic stage are insignificant, demonstrating the quasi-isotropic characteristics. Optimizing yarn properties of specific directions can significantly enhance the mechanical performance of triaxial woven fabric composites under multi-angle uniaxial stress. The simulations accurately reflect the tensile behavior and failure modes observed experimentally, providing a new modeling methodology for predicting mechanical properties and damage of triaxial woven fabric composites. Furthermore, the simulation results reveal that inter-yarn interfaces are minimally affected by tensile loading angles prior to structural failure, highlighting the robustness of yarn-to-yarn interactions.}
