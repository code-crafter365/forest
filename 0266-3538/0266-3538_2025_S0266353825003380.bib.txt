abstract = {A novel aramid fiber-reinforced composite with a polyurea elastomer matrix was fabricated and systematically evaluated for its mechanical properties and ballistic performance. Five groups of composite laminates with different polyurea contents, together with a reference epoxy-based laminate, were prepared. A series of quasi-static mechanical tests and ballistic impact experiments were then performed on these laminates. Furthermore, Multi scale finite element simulations were conducted to investigate the impact response and failure mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of polyurea as the matrix markedly enhances the energy absorption capacity, deformability, and ballistic resistance of the composite laminates compared to epoxy-based laminates. A polyurea content of 20 % was identified as providing the optimal balance between mechanical strength and toughness, resulting in the higher ballistic limit and specific energy absorption. The polyurea matrix enables greater fiber deformation and a more extensive stress distribution during impact, thereby enhancing energy dissipation. These findings indicate that polyurea elastomer matrix confers substantial advantages for the design of advanced, lightweight ballistic protective composites.}
