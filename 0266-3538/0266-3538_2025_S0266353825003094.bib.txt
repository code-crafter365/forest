abstract = {Fast and accurate prediction of mechanical properties and failure behavior are essential for the design and optimization of textile composites. In this paper, a novel synergistic multi-scale modeling approach is proposed to predict the progressive failure of two-dimensional triaxially braided composites. A theoretical-based multi-scale model is integrated with finite element calculation in the user subroutine, VUMAT. The developed multi-scale model enables real-time two-way coupled interactions for mechanical response and damage behavior at meso- and macro-scales, and it shows great computational efficiency and generality because of the theoretical nature of the multi-scale computational framework. The proposed framework is utilized to predict the mechanical responses and failure behaviors of different types of specimens: straight-sided, tube, and notched specimens. The predictions show good agreement with both the meso-scale finite element simulations and the experimental results, while reducing the computational time by more than 10 times as compared to the meso-scale model. The theoretical-numerical integrated multi-scale model provides a fast and reliable solution for modeling the progressive failure behavior of textile composite structures under various loading conditions.}
