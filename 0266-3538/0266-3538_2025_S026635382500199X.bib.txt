abstract = {Flexible piezoelectric sensor demonstrates significant advancements in wearable electronics. However, the development of piezoelectric materials capable of operating under extreme conditions with exceptional thermal stability remains a critical challenge. Herein, FPI/PAN nanofibrous composite membrane was fabricated via a co-electrospinning technique, achieving a synergistic integration of piezoelectric and triboelectric effects. The synergistic interaction enhances mechanical-to-electrical conversion efficiency through charge superposition and interfacial polarization. The as-prepared sensor demonstrates favorable piezoelectric voltage output of 8 V and rapid response and recovery times (12 ms and 14 ms, respectively). The piezoelectric output remains stable after 10,000 cycles at 15 Hz/10 N, demonstrating excellent durability. In addition, the sensor has the ability to accurately detect diverse human motions, such as joint flexion, eye-blinking, and dynamic impacts. Notably, the FPI/PAN membrane maintains structural stability before 500 °C. Furthermore, it is found that the membrane exhibits a low dielectric constant (1.62–1.67) and smaller dielectric loss (0.0008–0.0024) within the range of 0–1 MHz. This study represents a new path for design and development of self-powered nanofibrous wearable sensors.}
