abstract = {The development of silicone-based superhydrophobic coatings is highly desirable for antifouling applications. However, achieving durable coatings remains challenging. Superhydrophobicity is often lost after mechanical damage or microorganism penetration, which compromises the static antifouling ability. Herein, we propose a straightforward strategy for fabricating a silicone coating (F-PIBO-40 %) based on a simple condensation reaction between a novel silane telomer (F-PIBO) and α,ω-dihydroxypolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Moreover, nano-sized silica particles (SiO2) were uniformly incorporated to construct micro-nano rough structures and enhance the durability. The mechanical and environmental durability, self-cleaning, antibacterial and anti-diatom performance were comprehensively characterized. The results revealed that even after 400 damage cycles (8000 cm of wear), the contact angle remained above 165°. The superhydrophobic surface could be simply renewed through friction, minimizing the cost of use and replacement. Furthermore, the coating retained its superhydrophobic properties after exposure to UV radiation, hot/cold temperature cycling, and immersion in various polar and non-polar solvents. The synergistic effects of the isobornyl groups and the superhydrophobicity contributed to the excellent self-cleaning, antibacterial, and anti-diatom performance. We believe that this work provides a new approach for the preparation of multi-environmentally reliable, durable, and surface-renewable superhydrophobic antifouling coatings.}
