abstract = {By employing the molecular dynamics based Modified Sequential Absorption (MSA) algorithm, the 3D models containing high volume fraction spherical Al2O3/SR fillers (up to 62.41 vol%) were established for simulating the thermal performances of the composites. The formation probability of thermal conductive pathway inside the material was quantitatively characterized by the particle contact probability, where the effective contact was determined by a dimensionless comprehensive influencing parameter. Then, the effects of volume fraction, contact situation between fillers, interfacial thermal resistance, and the binary filling scheme on thermal conductivity of the composite material were investigated. Increasing the volume fraction can remarkably improve the thermal conductivity of composite materials. However, improvement of filler-filler contact and the filler-matrix contact shows less profit. The optimal proportion of small particles in the binary mixtures shows consistency at different volume fractions and the thermal conductivity of the composites steadily increases with the increase of the diameter ratio of two-sized fillers. This work is beneficial to understand the thermal conductive mechanism and guide the performance optimization of composites.}
