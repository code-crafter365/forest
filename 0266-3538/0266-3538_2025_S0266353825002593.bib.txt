abstract = {The burgeoning field of smart textiles, particularly those with photothermal conversion capabilities, is driven by the escalating need for energy-efficient and versatile thermoregulation solutions across healthcare, energy, and personal protection applications. Despite the promising potential of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. MoS2), their practical implementation has been hindered by challenges such as aggregation and the lack of a one-step continuous spinning process for the fabrication of high-performance photothermal fibers. This study addresses these gaps by employing in-situ polymerization to integrate MoS2 with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer, yielding the PET/MoS2 fibers and fabrics that exhibits excellent photothermal antibacterial properties. The uniform distribution of MoS2 within the PET matrix not only improves the fiber's mechanical integrity but also significantly enhances its photothermal performance and antibacterial activity under photothermal conditions. The tensile strength of the fabric was observed to increase with the incorporation of MoS2 up to an optimal loading amount. The photothermal performance was found to be exceptional under various light sources, with a direct correlation to the MoS2 content. The antibacterial efficacy was notably robust, achieving a 95% reduction in both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) under near-infrared irradiation. This study offers a scalable and efficient solution for advanced wearable thermal management, poised to redefine the future of personal comfort and healthcare technology.}
