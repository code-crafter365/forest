abstract = {The thermal management challenge in microelectronic products is a critical issue that must be addressed in the future era of intelligent technology. In this study, a phase change composite (CNCC-10), featuring a triple-encapsulated phase change material network and dual thermal conductive channels, was developed by compounding custom “rod-brush” structured CFs-CNTs (carbon nanotubes were grown on the surface of carbon fiber) filler with n-Docosane, ethylene propylene diene monomer, and metal foam via vacuum impregnation and hot pressing. The resulting material demonstrates remarkable shape stability alongside a high thermal conductivity of 3.15 W⋅m−1⋅K−1. In simulated chip operation tests, CNCC-10 not only delayed the rise in chip operating temperature but also steadily and consistently reduced the chip's working temperature by 12 °C. Under conditions of intense heat release and transient high-energy thermal shocks, CNCC-10 decreased the chip's working temperature by 23.15 °C and 50.1 °C, respectively, addressing the heating challenges under varying conditions. The integration of high thermal conductivity with phase change driven intelligent temperature control enables CNCC-10 to deliver exceptional chip thermal management performance and multi-source drive thermal management capabilities. This study provides a valuable reference for designing multifunctional thermal management materials for applications such as microelectronic devices, and artificial intelligence systems.}
