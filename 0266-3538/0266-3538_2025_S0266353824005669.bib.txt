abstract = {In space exploration, lightweight multifunctional materials capable of shielding neutron radiation, dissipating heat, and providing damping are essential. Polymer composites reinforced with boron nitride (BN) nanomaterials—specifically one-dimensional boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) and two-dimensional boron nitride nanoplatelets (BNNPs)—offer promising solutions. This study investigates how BN nanomaterial morphology influences the performance of high-temperature (HT) epoxy composites. We developed ultralightweight, three-dimensional BN foams comprising 1D BNNTs, 2D BNNPs, and hybrid 1D BNNT/2D BNNP structures via freeze-drying, then infiltrated them with HT epoxy to form dense composites. The BNNT foam exhibited the highest neutron radiation shielding, with a mass absorption coefficient of 26.64 cm2 g−1, outperforming the hybrid foam (18.18 cm2 g−1) and the BNNP foam (11.12 cm2 g−1). A similar trend was observed in the HT epoxy composites; incorporating these foams at least doubled the mass absorption coefficient compared to the neat polymer. In terms of thermal conductivity, the BNNT/BNNP foam-epoxy composite achieved the highest value of 0.34 W m−1 K−1, a 2.13-fold increase over neat HT epoxy. The BNNT/BNNP foam-epoxy composites also improved by 1.88 and 1.75 times, respectively. Mechanical testing revealed that BNNP foams withstood the highest loads during nanoindentation (3.53 kN), followed by BNNT/BNNP foams (1.93 kN) and BNNT foams (1.56 kN). All BN foam-epoxy composites exhibited enhanced damping properties, with tan δ increasing by at least 30 % compared to neat HT epoxy. These findings elucidate the impact of BN nanomaterial morphology on the multifunctional performance of HT epoxy composites, offering insights for developing high-performance, tailorable materials for demanding environments.}
