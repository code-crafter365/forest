abstract = {Thermally conductive and damping rubber materials could protect electronic components from the negative impact of vibration and heat built-up. Meanwhile, exploring a green and facile method to prepare and recycle the damping rubber materials is important. A hybrid filler was prepared by blending lignin, samarium chloride, and polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified graphene. Thermally conductive and damping carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber (XNBR) composites with recyclable capability were prepared by compounding the hybrid filler with XNBR and bio-based epoxidized soybean oil was used instead of conventional curing agents. The addition of the hybrid filler significantly increased the thermal conductivity, curing rate, equilibrium torque, and crosslink density of XNBR, and enhanced the damping and mechanical properties of XNBR. With the hybrid filler content increasing, the thermal conductivity, and damping properties of XNBR improved. The end-of-life XNBR composites could be recycled and reprocessed. The recycled and reprocessed composites have good damping, mechanical properties, and thermal conductivity. The work provides a new insight into green preparation and recycling of thermally conductive and damping rubber materials.}
