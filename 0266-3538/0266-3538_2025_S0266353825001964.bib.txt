abstract = {Nano-carbon materials, owing to the sp2-hybridized carbon and highly porous structure, exhibit significant potential for incorporating phase change materials (PCMs) in solar energy storage and utilization. However, this potential is limited by their suboptimal photothermal responsiveness and the absence of hierarchical pore structures. Herein, we propose a dynamic regulation strategy to fabricate a Ni@graphite carbon-penetrated hierarchical carbon (Ni@C/C) structure for encapsulation of octadecanol (ODA) molecules. Ni@C active sites anchored within the hierarchical carbon framework rapidly capture photons. The coupling between Ni0 nanoparticles (NPs) and graphitized carbon enhances the electric field distribution around the Ni0 NPs, significantly improving photothermal performance. As a result, ODA/Ni@C/C demonstrated a remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 94.5 % under simulated one-sun irradiation. Notably, ODA/Ni@C/C exhibits a rapid response to ambient temperature changes, and sustains heat release over an extended period across a broad temperature range, demonstrating significant potential for applications in heat therapy masks and lithium-ion battery thermal management systems. This work provides both theoretical insights and practical guidance for the targeted design and preparation of advanced nano-carbon materials-based phase change composites.}
