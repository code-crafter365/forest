abstract = {As critical components in oil drilling systems, the longevity of rubber seals for packer plays key role in operational safety and production efficiency in hydrocarbon extraction operations. Herein, this study comprehensively investigates the synergistic effects of bio-silicon carbon (SiCB) and hydroxide zinc monomethacrylate (HZMMA) as reinforcing fillers on the mechanical properties, aging resistance, and thermal stability of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) composites. The potential free radical scavenging capacity and structural characteristics of SiCB were characterized, while the vulcanization reinforcement characteristics and capture of radical mechanism for HZMMA were verified and evaluated through morphological and structural analyses. The mixture reinforcing fillers incorporating SiCB to HZMMA of 20:30 showed significant synergistic effect on the mechanical and thermal oxygen ageing properties of HNBR composites. Before and after thermal-oxidative aging, the retention of elongation at break in HNBR composites increased substantially from 11.4 % to 45 % in 30 days later at 150 °C. As expected, the minimal variations in both glass transition temperature (Tg) and crosslinking density during aging for the HNBR/SiCB/HZMMA composites were measured. Moreover, the improvement of the thermal stability for HNBR composites were confirmed by TG. This study provides novel insights and valuable references for developing the high-performance, long-service-life HNBR sealing materials in oil drilling operations.}
