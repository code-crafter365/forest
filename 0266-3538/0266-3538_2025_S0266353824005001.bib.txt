abstract = {Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) is widely used in new and existing structures, however, interfacial defects in the bonded joints pose a significant threat to structural integrity. Therefore, detection of interfacial defects is imperative for ensuring structural safety. This study proposes array infrared thermography (IRT) as a novel non-destructive evaluation method to visualize interfacial defects. Array IRT provides uniform heat excitation within the spatial domain, which overcomes the problem of heat concentration by conventional IRT. Forty-five bonded FRP plate specimens were tested using array IRT, results of which show that interfacial defects can be accurately detected within (8h + 8) s (where h is the thickness of the upper layer of FRP in mm). Array IRT achieves high accuracy in detecting shapes, particularly sharp corners of defects. A pre-processing method was proposed to eliminate the twisted angles of thermal camera and to more clearly show the defects in the thermograms. A database containing tested thermograms and the corresponding predefined defects was established. Intelligent algorithms - UNet, Deeplabv3, and YOLOv8 - were used to segment the defected regions for array IRT analysis, results of which show a precision of 95.8 %, 94.4 %, and 94.1 %, respectively.}
