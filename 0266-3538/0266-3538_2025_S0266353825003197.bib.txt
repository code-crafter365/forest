abstract = {Epoxy-based composites, leveraging their lightweight nature and design flexibility, have emerged as critical materials for thermal management and electromagnetic shielding applications. The rapid advancement of high-functional fields have driven the demand for multifunctional epoxy composites. In this study, nickel-diamond (N-D) hybrid thermally conductive fillers were co-deposited onto polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fiber felts via composite electrodeposition. Using Watts bath as the electrodeposition solution, we precisely controlled both current density and diamond particle concentration to achieve uniform dispersion of diamond particles and strong interfacial bonding within the carbon fiber matrix, thereby optimizing the comprehensive performance of epoxy composites. Under the optimal conditions of 2 A/dm2 current density and 16 g/L diamond concentration, the fabricated epoxy composite demonstrated superior thermal conductivity (3.17 W/mK), excellent electrical conductivity (37.7 S/cm), and a significantly reduced friction coefficient (0.44). Further thermal management tests demonstrated the composite's exceptional heat-transfer performance, offering a viable solution for thermal dissipation in highly integrated electronics.}
