abstract = {Magnetorheological Elastomers (MREs) have garnered significant attention in auxiliary forming due to their controllable mechanical properties. This study designs and prepares several styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) MREs containing carbonyl iron powders (CIPs). The effects of different particle contents and magnetic field strengths on the sectional distortion in rectangular aluminum profile bend-twist deformation are investigated through experiments and ABAQUS numerical simulations. The results indicate that CIPs content, CB/CNT content, and magnetic field strength significantly impact the magneto-mechanical properties of MREs. The optimal suppression of sectional distortion in rectangular profiles is observed with 80 wt% CIPs and 2 wt% CB/CNT under a magnetic field strength of 400 mT, reducing the maximum collapse rate from 13.17 % to 6.85 % and the maximum bulge rate from 1.40 % to 0.98 %.}
