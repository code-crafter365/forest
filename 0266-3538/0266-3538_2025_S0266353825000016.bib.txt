abstract = {Surface flashover poses a significant threat to the safety operation of high-voltage power equipment, which is further deteriorated by environmental conditions such as rain, moisture, and contamination in outdoor applications. In this work, a robust high-surface-insulating and superhydrophobic material, with three-dimensional (3D) “nanoparticles decorated porous structures”, was presented. Porous materials were prepared by the templating method, in which the sugar granules were used as the porogen. After that, SiC nanoparticles were attached to the pores by dip-coating method. The 3D porous structure with interconnected pores could effectively improve the flashover strength, due to the combined effect of hindering collision ionization, accelerating surface charge dissipation, and corona stabilization effect. And the flashover voltage increases with porosity, with a maximum increment over 48.1 % and 47.5 % for DC and AC flashover voltages, respectively. Moreover, the 3D “nanoparticles decorated porous structures” gives rise to bulk superhydrophobicity even on a slashed surface, which can withstand various kinds of mechanical damages including scratch, deformation, and slicing off. Moreover, the superhydrophobic materials possess effective deicing performances due to the combined effect of photothermal deicing and passive anti-icing properties. The present approach provides a new insight for fabricating robust insulation materials with both high-flashover-strength and superhydrophobicity.}
