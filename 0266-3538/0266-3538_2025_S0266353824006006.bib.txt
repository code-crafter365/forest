abstract = {With the advantage of lightweight, thermal insulation and flame retardant, aramid nanofibers (ANFs)-based aerogel is a promising functional material in military, aerospace and complex environmental applications, but its functionality still needs to be further optimized. Herein, we propose a flexible fabrication strategy to prepare ANFs-based multilayer aerogels through the freeze-casting method, acid-assisted protonation, and freeze-drying. This process integrates various composite ANFs-based aerogel layers to achieve multiple functions, and utilizes the mechanical toughening effects of the porous skeleton and nano-units at both macroscopic and microscopic scales, ensuring strong interlayer bonding force and fluffier skeleton structure, just like the stacking and stitching of LEGO. The different multifunctional degrees of aerogels can be obtained by controlling the structural configuration. Through this process, ANFs-based aerogel with the multilayer configuration of SiC-CNT-SiC/ANF has the lightweight characteristics (0.04711 g/cm3), effective thermal insulation, flame retardant and compression properties (113.83 KPa), which also shows certain joule thermal performance.}
