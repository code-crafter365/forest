abstract = {The harsh application environment poses higher requirements for the operating temperature of dielectric energy storage capacitors. Suppressing carrier transport at high temperatures is a key method to increase the breakdown field strength (Eb) and the operating temperature of dielectrics. In this paper, low-concentration P-type semiconductor nickel oxide quantum dots (NiOx QDs) were surface modified with polydopamine (PDA) and introduced into the polymer matrix, with the aim to capture hot carriers by constructing hole traps, thereby increasing the high-temperature Eb and energy storage density (Udis) of the polymer. The results confirmed the efficiency of the strategy. At 90 °C, the Eb of the NiOx@PDA/P(VDF-HFP) film reached 2242.78 kV/cm, and the Udis reached 2.94 J/cm3, which were 42.41 % and 164.86 % higher than those of the pure P(VDF-HFP) film. Thermal and mechanical analyses indicated that the enhanced Eb and Udis were mainly attributed to the restriction of the Poole-Frenkel emission within the dielectrics. Together with the enhanced compatibility of the organic-inorganic composite interface, the macro defects of the composites were further suppressed and electrical properties were further increased. This work offers a straightforward and efficient approach for manufacturing high-temperature energy storage dielectrics.}
