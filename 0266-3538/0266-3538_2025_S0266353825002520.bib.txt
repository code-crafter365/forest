abstract = {A green, environmentally friendly, and low-cost method is used to grow carbon nanotubes on the surface of carbon fibers, resulting in CNTs/CF composites. The mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, microwave absorption performance and ablation resistant behaviour of the prepared composites are investigated. Similar with effect of ‘lying on a bed of nails’, CNTs/CF composite exhibits low density (0.55 g/cm3) and can withstand loads up to 2000 times their own weight while maintaining structural integrity. The prepared composite not only exhibits enhanced heat transfer compared with copper, but also demonstrates electromagnetic wave absorption capabilities and ablation resistance. Remarkable improvement in electromagnetic wave absorption has been demonstrated with introduction of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which confirms the “versatility” of the composting process in such reaction system. Correspondingly, the maximum reflection loss of the composite material can reach −54.6 dB. For ablation resistance, CNTs/CF composite can withstand high temperatures up to about 1200 °C without any changes in macroscopic morphology. These integrated characteristics make CNTs/CF composite a promising lightweight structural material for aerospace, military, and other industries.}
