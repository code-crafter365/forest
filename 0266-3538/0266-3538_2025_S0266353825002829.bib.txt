abstract = {The focus on composite films with high dielectric properties is largely attributable to their extensive range of applications in electrical equipment. Nevertheless, there is a recognized issue concerning the fact that the dielectric properties of the materials do not fully satisfy the mounting performance requirements in practical applications. In this work, the heterostructure of MnO2 grown on the surface of 2D transition metal carbide Ti3C2 MXene doped with carbon quantum dots (CD-MnO2@MXene) has been successfully obtained through hydrothermal reaction. CD-MnO2@MXene was combined with poly (dimethyl siloxane)-based copolymers (D-PDMS) to form the PDMS-based dielectric composites (CD-MnO2@MXene/D-PDMS) via solution casting method. The CD-MnO2@MXene/D-PDMS composite containing 2.17 vol% of CD-MnO2@MXene exhibits an enhanced dielectric constant of 42.2 at 100 Hz, which is 12 times and 1.58 times higher than that of the pure matrix and the CD@MXene/D-PDMS composite, meanwhile the loss is only 0.07. These results validate that the CD-MnO2@MXene/D-PDMS composite possesses excellent dielectric properties and low energy loss compared with other nanocomposites, thus can be widely used in advanced electronic devices such as actuators and sensors.}
