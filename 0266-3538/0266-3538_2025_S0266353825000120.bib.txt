abstract = {The impact surface of stomatopod dactyl clubs is characterized by dense packing of nanoparticles in an organic matrix, which could protect the underlying composite structure from intense impact load. Inspired by bionics, a strategy of introducing a damping coating filled with high-content nanoparticles on laminate surface is proposed to improve the impact performance of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminate. In this study, a bio-inspired composite composed of a basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) laminate with helicoidal layups and a damping coating of styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) filled with soft-hard partitioned Janus nanoparticles (JNPs) is designed. The low velocity impact response and damage performance of the bio-inspired composites with different coating thicknesses over a wide range of impact energies were investigated experimentally. The experimental results indicate that the introduction of the SBR/JNPs coating could regulate the energy absorption of BFRP laminate according to the impact energy levels, reducing and increasing the absorbed energy at low energy and high energy impacts, respectively. Furthermore, a numerical finite element (FE) model of the bio-inspired composite was also constructed to elucidate the damage mechanisms, which agrees well with the experiment results due to considering the plasticity of the filled coating. The simulation results demonstrate that SBR/JNPs coating is able to deconcentrate the impact load over a large area and dissipate impact energy by its own deformation. The developed strategy and investigation into the impact performance and damage mechanism provide insight into the development and application of BFRP laminates in transportation, aerospace, and defense fields.}
