abstract = {This paper presents an expression for the effective elastic moduli of carbon woven fabric-reinforced shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) based on a revised Eshelby's inclusion theorem, followed by the development of an empirical constitutive model that incorporates storage strain. The model's effectiveness is verified through thermomechanical and shape memory experiments on SMPCs with varying fiber volume fractions. Furthermore, several important experimental phenomena are observed. Firstly, the glass transition temperature of the SMPCs shifts to a higher value compared to the matrix. Secondly, SMPCs exhibit an initial expansion phase followed by contraction during the cooling process. Thirdly, while the shape fixation ratio of the SMPCs decreases, their shape recovery ratio remains higher than that of the matrix. The mechanisms behind these experimental phenomena are investigated within the proposed model, offering deeper insights into the behavior of SMPCs.}
