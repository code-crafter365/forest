abstract = {It is of great significance for enhancing the in-plane fracture toughness of 3D woven composite (3DWC) to study the failure mechanism of a single edge notch tension (SENT) test. It requires high computational demand to establish the SENT finite element (FE) model using conformal modeling methods. In this paper, a ternary model is proposed to analyze the damage and fracture of 3DWC. The matrix cracking, yarn rupture, and interface failure between the yarn and matrix are considered. Firstly, the ternary models are verified by the uniaxial tensile tests. Subsequently, the SENT FE models are established using the ternary model. Progressive damage analyses of the SENT tests are conducted. A good consistency of the load-displacement relationships from the SENT FE models and tests is achieved. The failure mechanisms of warp and weft SENT tests are revealed. Finally, the influences of interface failure and yarn fracture toughness on the mechanical behaviors of SENT FE models are discussed. The proposed ternary model can consider the influence of interface failure on the mechanical behavior of 3DWC, compared to the binary model. It is much more efficient than the conformal modeling methods.}
