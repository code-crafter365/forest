abstract = {Human activities, ranging from medical applications to space exploration, face significant threats from multiband electromagnetic radiation. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the complex radiation environments of space. There is an urgent need for high-efficiency, stable broadband electromagnetic shielding materials to safeguard human health and equipment safety. Herein, a Bi-modified W18O49/MWCNTs/PAN hybrid nanofiber membrane is successfully prepared by electrospinning and post-treatment. Relying on the synergistic effect of Bi, W18O49, MWCNTs, and porous structures, excellent broadband radiation protection capability is achieved: (i) Low near-infrared-visible-light (NIR-VIS) transmittance (0.62 %); (ii) Ultraviolet (UV) transmittance of only 0.012 % and UPF value as high as 2000; (iii) Mass attenuation coefficient up to 16.18 cm2 g−1 and attenuation ratio of 85.74 % (thickness: 4 mm) at 33 keV X-ray energy. Furthermore, porous structure and high specific surface area give the membrane ultralight density (0.36 g cm−3), flexibility, and outstanding air permeability (8.5 kg m−2 d−1). Even after 2000 bends, it still maintains stable structure and performance. Meanwhile, low thermal conductivity (42.2 mW m−1 K−1) and superior temperature resistance (300 °C) enable it to adapt to complex and changing environments. These advantages make the membrane highly promising for radiation protection in medical, industrial, and aerospace applications.}
