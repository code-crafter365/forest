abstract = {A series of microstructured superhydrophobic surfaces prepared by biomimicry exhibit unique advantages in the field of anti-icing/de-icing. However, the synergistic effect between microstructural morphology modulation and functional composites, as well as the mechanism of influence on anti-icing/de-icing in different low-temperature environments remain to be explored. Here, leveraging the shape memory effect and electrothermal/photothermal response characteristics of composite materials, a synergistic anti-icing/de-icing system integrating passive anti-icing mechanisms with active de-icing strategies has been systematically investigated. The dynamic impact behaviours of droplets at different temperatures and microstructural morphology were investigated. Elucidating the mechanisms of electrothermal/photothermal response and microstructural morphology transformation. Modulation of droplet impact behavior to avoid ice formation, reduction of surface heat transfer efficiency to delay the icing process, and decrease of ice adhesion to achieve removal of surface-coated ice. Combining the electrothermal/photothermal responsiveness of the substrate functional materials and the reversible conversion properties of the surface microstructure, it provides a new idea for the research of full-process, intelligent-response anti-icing/de-icing.}
