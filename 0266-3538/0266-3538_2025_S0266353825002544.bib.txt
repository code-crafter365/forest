abstract = {The growing demand for renewable energy storage has highlighted the demand of dielectric capacitors with high performances. While multilayer composites show promise by combining insulation layers and polarization layers, their performance optimization remains challenging due to complex layers number and insulation/polarization volume content dependent behaviors. This work presents an optimized multilayer composite via spatial structure design that strategically combines the Ni(OH)2@PDI/P(VDF-HFP) (NPP) insulation layers and Ni(OH)2/P(VDF-HFP) (NP) polarization layers. Through precise regulation of layers number and NPP volume content within the multilayer composite, the optimized interlayer interfacial effects, the coupling effects of insulation and polarization layers, as well as the related intralayer contributions result in a significantly discharged enhanced energy storage density of 32.1 J/cm3 and a high charge-discharge efficiency of 80.7 % at 705.7 MV/m for the 4 layers 62.5 vol% NPP/NP composite. Our findings provide both fundamental insights into multilayer dielectric design and a practical strategy for developing high-capacity energy storage dielectrics for renewable energy storage applications.}
