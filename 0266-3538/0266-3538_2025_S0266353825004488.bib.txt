abstract = {Process-induced deformation (PID) during the curing of thermoset composites, driven by complex mechanisms, compromises the load-bearing capacity and service life of assembled components. This study explores a gravity-driven strategy, inspired by gravitropism in plant root growth, to suppress PID and enhance the performance of thin-walled S-glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates for aerospace applications. The upside-down molding (UM) process, leveraging gravitational resin flow, reduced thickness variance by up to 47.37% and curing deformation by up to 24.28% compared to conventional molding (CM). Three-point bending tests revealed UM improved bending strength stability, energy absorption density rises of 16.10%. These enhancements, attributed to optimized interlayer resin distribution, suggest potential for aerospace structural applications.}
