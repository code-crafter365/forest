abstract = {Basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) composites have been finding more applications in the aerospace, automotive, energy, and civil engineering sectors, driving demand for versions of such material with more advanced properties such as damage self-sensing. In this study, a novel multifunctional BFRP has been developed. Firstly, a hybrid coating composed of graphene nanoplate, carbon nanotube, and poly (phthalazinone ether sulfone ketone) was developed. The coating was then used to modify the basalt fiber, while additional carbon nanotubes were integrated into a poly (arylene ether nitrile) matrix. This hierarchical approach, combining micro-scale fiber surface modifications and nano-scale matrix reinforcements, significantly increases the mechanical performance of the BFRP, boosting tensile strength and modulus by 44.1 % and 26.4 % respectively, and flexural strength and modulus by 47.9 % and 121.3 % respectively. Finite element analysis and molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the thickened fiber-matrix interface and enhanced interfacial interaction contribute to these mechanical improvements. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure elevates electrical conductivity from an insulating state to 7.0 × 10−4 S/m with only 0.9 wt% nanofillers, while enabling damage self-sensing functionality. The composite exhibits a high sensing sensitivity (gauge factor = 591) during the damage stage and an excellent cyclic stability during the elastic stage. Notably, enhanced self-sensing sensitivity at elevated temperatures was observed, highlighting the composite's potential for high-temperature applications. The presented work provides an effective solution for developing multifunctional BFRP with enhanced mechanical, electrical, and damage self-sensing properties, making such material suitable for a wide range of demanding applications such as structural-functional integrated load-bearing components.}
