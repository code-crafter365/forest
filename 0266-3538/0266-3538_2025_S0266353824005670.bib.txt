abstract = {This research focuses on the fabrication and analysis of novel natural fibre hybrid composites using two different reinforcement techniques: intralaminar reinforcement (2D) and orthogonal-through-the-thickness reinforcement (3D-OTT). Jute bidirectional fabric served as the main fibre phase, while secondary reinforcement phases (sisal, curauá, and glass fibres) were woven unidirectionally through the jute fabric for the 2D architecture (intralaminar reinforcement). For the 3D architecture, a transverse fibre phase was additionally woven orthogonally through the thickness of the fibre preforms. Pure jute and glass fibre-reinforced composites were also fabricated and tested for comparison. Tensile, flexural, and impact tests were performed to assess how the innovative 3D-OTT architecture influences in-plane composite properties. SEM analysis and X-ray microtomography were used to examine failure modes, interfacial quality and void volume fractions. The results support the viability of the novel composite materials for partial or complete substitution of glass fibre-reinforced materials (GFRP) in specific applications. For instance, curauá-reinforced specimens demonstrated comparable tensile and flexural stiffness to synthetic composites, while 3D-reinforced sisal specimens exhibited exceptional energy absorption during impact testing. Additionally, the simple fabrication process resulted in very low void fractions, making these composites suitable for the automotive industry.}
