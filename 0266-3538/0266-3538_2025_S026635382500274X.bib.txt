abstract = {There are numerous microcracks in three-dimensional angle-interlock woven composites under low-velocity impact. The existence of microcracks will deteriorate stiffness and strength significantly. However, existing studies primarily focus on visible cracks. The description of microcracks is still a challenge. This study proposes a deep learning method to find the microcrack distributions in 3D woven composites under low-velocity impact. We employed an attention-enhanced model to improve the microcrack detection efficiency to 88.7% and utilized the U-Net model to achieve a 99% pixel-level segmentation accuracy. Through principal component analysis, crack classification, three-dimensional reconstruction, and connectivity analysis, the spatial distribution and evolution patterns of microcracks have been precisely captured. The results show that weft yarn cracks accounted for 83.2% of microcracks under low-energy (3J) impact. Under high-energy (23J) impact, the connectivity among microcracks and visible cracks increased, with a significant rise in the proportion of interface debonding, forming a interlaced crack network. This study addresses two critical gaps: automated detection of sub-millimeter microcracks (MiC) ignored in conventional analysis and quantitative characterization of MiC’s role in damage evolution under varying impact energies.}
