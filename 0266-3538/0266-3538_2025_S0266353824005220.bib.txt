abstract = {Structural batteries require thermally stable electrolytes paired with carbon fibers (CFs), which offer advantages of lightweight, high mechanical strength, and good electrical conductivity. This work evaluated various room-temperature ionic-liquids (RTILs) as compatible electrolytes for CF anodes and LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes on CFs. This LFP/CF full-cell design eliminates Cu and Al current-collectors, potentially enhancing gravimetric energy and reducing costs. Among various RTILs, LiTFSI in N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (PYR13) – bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI) offered promising LFP/CF full-cell performances, attributed to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the CF anode with components such as Li2Sx, Li2S–SO3, LiF, LixFy and F–SO2, identified through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analyses further confirmed the electrochemical stability of the SEI layer on CF anodes. The LFP/CF cell delivered an initial capacity of 119 mAh/g and relatively high Coulombic efficiency when using the 1 M LiTFSI in PYR13-FSI. CF cycled in different electrolytes exhibit varying mechanical properties with up to 10.08 % loss in tensile strength, which may be related to CF surface degradation during cycling. The 1 M LiTFSI in PYR13-FSI is non-flammable, offering a significant thermal safety. This work successfully demonstrated the significant potential of 1 M LiTFSI in PYR13-FSI RTILs, which enables the use of CF as both an anode active material and cathode current collector for structural battery applications.}
