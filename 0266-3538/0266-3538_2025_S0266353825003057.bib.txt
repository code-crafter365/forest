abstract = {This study designed a novel carbon fiber pyramid-honeycomb structure to enhance shear performance. Using honeycomb stretching technology, a pyramid-honeycomb preparation method combining topological deformation design was proposed. A theoretical model was established to reveal the failure mechanism and predict the strength, stiffness, and failure mode of the honeycomb. The reliability of the theoretical model was verified through results that were highly similar to those obtained from corresponding simulations and experiments. The results indicated that the shear performance of honeycomb was significantly improved while maintaining a certain level of compression performance. The extremely thin wall thickness resulted in an extremely low honeycomb density and the failure mode of the honeycomb in all experiments was buckling failure of the sidewalls. The study provides a novel idea for designing and manufacturing composite honeycomb materials in the aerospace field.}
